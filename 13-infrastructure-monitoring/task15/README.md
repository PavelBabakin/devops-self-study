# Task 15: Create custom dashboards in Datadog to visualize key metrics.

In Task 14, we explored Datadog's built-in integrations, allowing us to monitor various metrics efficiently. In Task 15, we'll take a step further by learning how to create custom dashboards in Datadog. Custom dashboards enable you to tailor your monitoring setup to your specific needs, providing a focused view of the most critical metrics.

### **Prerequisites:**

Before we begin, ensure you have:

1. A Datadog account and the Datadog agent installed on your server or local machine (as discussed in Task 12).
2. A good understanding of the key metrics you want to visualize.

### **Creating Custom Dashboards in Datadog:**

Follow these steps to create custom dashboards in Datadog and visualize key metrics:

1. **Access the Datadog Dashboard:**
    
    Log in to your Datadog account and navigate to the Datadog dashboard.
    
2. **Create a New Dashboard:**
    - Click on the "Dashboards" menu.
    - Select "New Dashboard" to create a new custom dashboard.
3. **Add Widgets to the Dashboard:**
    
    Your custom dashboard is essentially a canvas where you can add widgets to visualize metrics. Click the "Add Widget" button to select a widget type to add to the dashboard.
    
    Datadog offers various widget types, including time series graphs, top lists, event streams, and more. Choose a widget type that best represents the key metrics you want to monitor.
    
4. **Configure Widgets:**
    
    After adding a widget, you'll need to configure it to display the desired metric data. The configuration options may vary depending on the widget type. Typically, you'll need to specify:
    
    - Data source: Choose the integration or metric source you want to visualize.
    - Metric: Select the specific metric you want to display.
    - Visualization settings: Adjust the appearance, time range, and axes as needed.
5. **Customize the Dashboard Layout:**
    
    You can customize the layout of your dashboard by adding and arranging widgets. Datadog allows you to move, resize, and organize widgets to create an organized and visually appealing layout.
    
6. **Add Multiple Widgets:**
    
    Continue adding widgets to your dashboard to monitor various metrics. You can mix and match widget types to create a comprehensive view of your infrastructure. For example, you can add graphs, top lists, and event streams to the same dashboard.
    
7. **Set Up Alerts:**
    
    To proactively address issues, consider configuring alerts for the metrics displayed on your custom dashboard. You can set up alerting rules based on the widget data, ensuring you receive notifications when metrics exceed specified thresholds.
    
8. **Save the Dashboard:**
    
    Once you've configured your custom dashboard and added the necessary widgets, don't forget to save it. Give the dashboard a meaningful name that reflects its purpose and content.
    
9. **Share the Dashboard:**
    
    Datadog allows you to share your custom dashboard with others in your team or organization. You can create shareable links to give colleagues access to the dashboard without needing to log in to your Datadog account.
    
10. **Access and Monitor Your Custom Dashboard:**
    
    To monitor your key metrics, simply navigate to your custom dashboard from the "Dashboards" menu. Here, you can view the real-time data and visualizations for the metrics you've selected.
    

Conclusion:

Creating custom dashboards in Datadog is a valuable skill for monitoring and analyzing key metrics effectively. In this article, we walked through the process of creating custom dashboards, adding widgets to represent metrics, configuring widgets, and customizing the dashboard layout.

With custom dashboards, you can create tailored views of your infrastructure, focusing on the metrics that matter most to you and your team. In the upcoming tasks, we will delve into advanced monitoring techniques, alerting, and integrations to further enhance your monitoring capabilities.
