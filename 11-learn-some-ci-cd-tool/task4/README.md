# Task 4: Write a basic Jenkinsfile to define a pipeline for building, testing, and deploying an application.

Jenkins pipelines allow you to define your entire CI/CD process as code, making it easy to version control and automate your builds, tests, and deployments. In this task, we'll create a basic Jenkinsfile to define a pipeline for building, testing, and deploying an application.

### **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have Jenkins installed, and you've set up a freestyle project as we discussed in Task 2. You should also have a basic understanding of how your application's build and test processes work.

### **Creating a Jenkinsfile**

A Jenkinsfile is a text file that contains the definition of a Jenkins Pipeline. It's written in a domain-specific language and is used to describe the steps and stages of your CI/CD process.

Here's a simple example of a Jenkinsfile for a Java application:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                // Check out the source code from your Git repository
                checkout scm
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // Build the Java application (e.g., Maven or Gradle)
                sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                // Run tests for the application
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                // Deploy the application to a server
                sh 'ssh user@server "deploy-script.sh"'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This Jenkinsfile defines a simple pipeline with four stages: Checkout, Build, Test, and Deploy. You can customize the commands and scripts according to your project's requirements.

### **Adding the Jenkinsfile to Your Project**

To use this Jenkinsfile, follow these steps:

1. Create a new text file named **`Jenkinsfile`** in the root of your project.
2. Copy and paste the Jenkinsfile code into the file.
3. Save the file and commit it to your Git repository.

### **Configuring Your Jenkins Project**

Next, you'll need to configure your Jenkins project to use the Jenkinsfile:

1. Open your Jenkins web interface.
2. Navigate to your project (the freestyle project created in Task 2).
3. In the project's configuration, under the "Build Configuration" section, select "Pipeline script from SCM."
4. In the "Script Path" field, enter the path to your Jenkinsfile, e.g., **`Jenkinsfile`**.
5. Save your project's configuration.

### **Running the Pipeline**

Now, whenever changes are pushed to your Git repository, Jenkins will automatically detect them and run the pipeline defined in your Jenkinsfile. You can also manually trigger the build from the Jenkins web interface.

### **Conclusion**

Creating a Jenkinsfile to define a pipeline is a fundamental step in implementing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for your projects. It allows you to version control and automate your entire CI/CD process. Jenkins provides great flexibility, allowing you to define pipelines in a way that suits your project's specific requirements.
