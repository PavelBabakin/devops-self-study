# Task 13: Explore Artifactory's build integration to capture build info and related artifacts.

Task 13 of your DevOps journey focuses on exploring JFrog Artifactory's build integration capabilities. Artifactory offers powerful features for capturing build information and managing related artifacts. By leveraging these features, you can enhance traceability, reproducibility, and overall efficiency in your software development process. Let's dive into the process of capturing build info and managing related artifacts.

**Prerequisites**

Before we proceed, ensure that you have:

1. Successfully set up and configured JFrog Artifactory, including users, groups, and permissions, as explained in previous tasks.
2. Access to the Artifactory dashboard.

**Capturing Build Information**

**Step 1: Set Up Build Integration**

1. **Access the Artifactory Dashboard**: Log in to the Artifactory dashboard using your web browser.
2. **Navigate to the Admin Section**: Click on the "Admin" tab in the left sidebar.
3. **Artifactory Services Configuration**: Under the "Advanced" section, select "Artifactory Services Configuration."
4. **Build Integration**: In the "Build Integration" tab, you can enable and configure Artifactory to capture build information. Ensure that this feature is enabled.

**Step 2: Capture Build Info in Your Build Process**

1. **Integrate Artifactory into Your Build Tool**: Depending on your build tool (e.g., Maven, Gradle, or others), configure your build process to capture and send build information to Artifactory. Typically, you will need to set up plugins or extensions to achieve this.
2. **Build Artifacts**: Run your build process as usual. Artifactory will capture build information, including the details of the build, the artifacts produced, and dependencies used.

**Managing Related Artifacts**

**Step 3: Access Build Info and Artifacts**

1. **Navigate to the Artifacts Browser**: In the Artifactory dashboard, click on the "Artifacts" tab.
2. **Filter Build Info**: Use filters or search functionality to locate build information. You can search by build name, version, or other attributes.
3. **View Build Info**: Click on the build info to access details such as the build name, number, date, and the related artifacts.

**Use Cases and Benefits**

- **Traceability**: Capturing build information in Artifactory provides comprehensive traceability, allowing you to identify which artifacts were produced in a specific build and which dependencies were used.
- **Reproducibility**: With build info, you can reproduce a specific build with the exact dependencies and versions used, ensuring consistent and reproducible builds.
- **Efficiency**: Integration with build tools streamlines the management of build information and related artifacts, improving overall efficiency in the DevOps workflow.
- **Troubleshooting**: Captured build info is invaluable for troubleshooting and debugging issues, as it provides insights into the exact conditions of the build.
- **Historical Data**: Artifactory keeps historical build information, providing a record of all past builds, their artifacts, and dependencies.

Conclusion

Exploring JFrog Artifactory's build integration capabilities is a powerful step in your DevOps journey. Capturing build information and managing related artifacts enhances traceability, reproducibility, and overall efficiency in your software development process. The ability to reproduce specific builds with exact dependencies and versions is essential for maintaining stability and consistency. In the upcoming tasks, we'll continue to explore advanced DevOps actions, such as setting up replication, using the Artifactory Query Language (AQL), implementing cleanup policies, and integrating Artifactory with CI/CD tools. Stay tuned for additional hands-on exercises and insights on your journey to becoming a proficient DevOps engineer.
