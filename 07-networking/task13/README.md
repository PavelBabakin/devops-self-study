# Task 13: Set up a local DNS server using software like bind9.

Setting up a local DNS server can enhance your network by providing quicker domain resolution, managing domain-specific rules, and aiding in network testing. BIND9 (Berkeley Internet Name Domain version 9) is a widely-used DNS server software that allows you to establish your own DNS server. In this guide, we will explore the steps to set up a local DNS server using BIND9.

**Prerequisites**

- A Linux machine (Ubuntu/Debian recommended)
- Basic understanding of DNS and terminal commands
- Root or sudo access to the machine

**Step 1: Installing BIND9**

1. **Update System Packages**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
    ```
    
2. **Install BIND9**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install bind9 bind9utils bind9-doc
    ```
    

**Step 2: Configuring BIND9**

1. **Navigate to BIND Configuration**:
    
    ```bash
    cd /etc/bind
    ```
    
2. **Edit named.conf.options**:Configure the options according to your requirements, such as specifying forwarders (external DNS servers for resolving external domains).
    
    ```bash
    sudo nano named.conf.options
    ```
    

**Step 3: Creating a DNS Zone**

1. **Edit named.conf.local**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo nano named.conf.local
    ```
    
2. **Add Zone Configuration**:Replace **`example.local`** with your desired domain.
    
    ```bash
    zone "example.local" {
        type master;
        file "/etc/bind/db.example.local";
    };
    ```
    

**Step 4: Configuring the DNS Zone**

1. **Create Zone File**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo nano db.example.local
    ```
    
2. **Add DNS Records**:Adjust the domain, IP addresses, and other records according to your setup.
    
    ```bash
    ;
    ; BIND data file for example.local
    ;
    $TTL    604800
    @       IN      SOA     example.local. root.example.local. (
                              2         ; Serial
                         604800         ; Refresh
                          86400         ; Retry
                        2419200         ; Expire
                         604800 )       ; Negative Cache TTL
    ;
    @       IN      NS      example.local.
    @       IN      A       192.168.1.10
    www     IN      A       192.168.1.10
    ```
    

**Step 5: Testing the DNS Server**

1. **Restart BIND9**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart bind9
    ```
    
2. **Test DNS Resolution**:Ensure the response includes the correct IP address.
    
    ```bash
    dig @localhost example.local
    ```
    

**Step 6: Configuring Clients to Use the DNS Server**

- Ensure client machines are configured to use the IP address of your BIND9 server as their DNS server.

**Conclusion**

Congratulations! You have successfully set up a local DNS server using BIND9, providing you with the capability to manage domain resolution within your network. This setup allows you to create domain-specific rules, enhance network testing, and potentially improve domain resolution times within your local network.
