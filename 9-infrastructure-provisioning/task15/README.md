# Task 15: Integrate Pulumi with your CI/CD pipeline for automated infrastructure deployments.

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are pivotal in automating the software delivery process. Integrating Pulumi with your CI/CD pipeline ensures that your infrastructure is consistently and reliably deployed alongside your application code. In this guide, we’ll explore how to integrate Pulumi with a CI/CD pipeline for automated infrastructure deployments.

---

**Step 1: Understanding Pulumi in CI/CD**

- **Automated Deployments:** Automatically apply infrastructure changes during the CI/CD process.
- **Consistency:** Ensure infrastructure consistency across different environments (dev, staging, production).
- **Collaboration:** Enable team collaboration by storing and versioning infrastructure code in a shared repository.

---

**Step 2: Setting Up Pulumi for CI/CD**

1. **Pulumi Access Token:** Generate a Pulumi access token from the [Pulumi Console](https://app.pulumi.com/account/tokens) for authenticating CI/CD workflows.
2. **Storing Secrets:** Securely store the Pulumi access token in your CI/CD platform’s secret manager.

---

**Step 3: Configuring the CI/CD Pipeline**

### **Example: Integrating Pulumi with GitHub Actions**

1. **GitHub Repository:** Store your Pulumi project in a GitHub repository.
2. **GitHub Actions:** Utilize GitHub Actions for the CI/CD pipeline.

**.github/workflows/pulumi_deploy.yml:**

```yaml
name: Deploy Infrastructure with Pulumi

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  pulumi_deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Configure Pulumi Credentials
      uses: pulumi/actions@v3
      with:
        cloud-url: ${{ secrets.PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN }}

    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: |
        npm install

    - name: Deploy to Pulumi
      run: |
        pulumi stack select dev
        pulumi up --yes
```

---

**Step 4: Managing Pulumi Stacks in CI/CD**

- **Stack Selection:** Ensure the correct Pulumi stack (e.g., dev, staging, prod) is selected for deployment.
- **Automated Approvals:** Use **`-yes`** flag to approve changes automatically (ensure review in Pull Requests).

---

**Step 5: Handling Pulumi Outputs**

- **Exporting Outputs:** Use Pulumi stack outputs to share resource attributes (e.g., URLs, IDs) with subsequent CI/CD steps.
- **Utilizing Outputs:** Leverage outputs in your application deployment steps for dynamic configuration.

---

**Step 6: Managing Pulumi State**

- **Backend Configuration:** Ensure Pulumi state is stored in a secure, centralized backend (e.g., Pulumi SaaS, AWS S3).
- **State Locking:** Utilize state locking to prevent concurrent updates and maintain consistency.

---

**Step 7: Monitoring and Auditing**

- **Pulumi Console:** Monitor deployments and review resource changes in the Pulumi Console.
- **Audit Logs:** Utilize audit logs in the Pulumi Console to track actions and changes.

---

**Conclusion**

Integrating Pulumi with CI/CD pipelines empowers teams to automate infrastructure deployments, ensuring consistency and reliability across different environments. By managing infrastructure code alongside application code, teams can ensure that applications and their required infrastructure are always in sync, reducing manual errors and enhancing collaboration.
