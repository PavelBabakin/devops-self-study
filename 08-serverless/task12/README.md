# Task 12: Create your first Azure Function using the Azure Portal.

Azure Functions empower developers to build event-driven, scalable, and serverless applications on the Microsoft Azure platform. With a variety of triggers and bindings, you can create versatile applications that respond to events and seamlessly integrate with various Azure services. In this guide, we will walk through the steps to create your first Azure Function using the Azure Portal, setting the foundation for your serverless journey on Azure.

**Step 1: Navigating to Azure Functions**

1. **Azure Portal:**
    - Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and navigate to the Azure Functions service.
2. **Creating a Function App:**
    - Click on “Create a resource” and select “Function App” to initiate the creation of your first function app.

**Step 2: Configuring the Function App**

1. **Basic Configuration:**
    - **Subscription:** Choose your Azure subscription.
    - **Resource Group:** Select or create a resource group for organizing related resources.
    - **Function App Name:** Assign a unique name to your function app.
    - **Publish:** Choose “Code” to publish code, or “Docker Container” for containerized applications.
    - **Runtime Stack:** Select the runtime that corresponds to your programming language of choice (e.g., .NET, Node.js, Python).
2. **Hosting and Monitoring:**
    - Configure the hosting plan, region, and storage account.
    - Set up Application Insights for monitoring your function app.

**Step 3: Creating Your First Function**

1. **Navigate to Your Function App:**
    - Once the function app is deployed, navigate to it within the Azure Portal.
2. **Add a New Function:**
    - Click on the “+ Add” button next to “Functions” in the left navigation pane.
3. **Function Configuration:**
    - **Development Environment:** Choose “Develop in portal” for in-portal development.
    - **Template:** Select a template based on your use case (e.g., HTTP trigger, Timer trigger).
    - **Function Name:** Assign a name to your function.
    - **Authorization Level:** Choose an authorization level for your function (e.g., Anonymous, Function, Admin).

**Step 4: Authoring and Testing the Function**

1. **Code Editor:**
    - Utilize the in-portal code editor to write the logic for your function. Modify the sample code as per your requirements.
2. **Testing the Function:**
    - Click on the “Test/Run” button, configure a test input if necessary, and run the function to validate its functionality.
    
    Example Function (Node.js):
    
    ```jsx
    module.exports = async function (context, req) {
        context.res = {
            body: "Hello, Azure Functions!"
        };
    };
    ```
    

---

**Step 5: Monitoring the Function**

1. **Logs and Output:**
    - View the logs and output within the portal to troubleshoot and validate the function’s execution.
2. **Application Insights:**
    - Navigate to Application Insights to explore detailed monitoring, logging, and telemetry data for your function.
