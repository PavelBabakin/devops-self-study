# Task 20: Practice handling a "break glass" scenario where you simulate a disaster and recover your Vault instance.

In our ongoing exploration of HashiCorp Vault, we have reached a critical task: practicing a "break glass" scenario. In this article, we'll delve into Task 20, which involves simulating a disaster and ensuring the recovery of your Vault instance. Preparing for such scenarios is essential for maintaining the resilience and security of your secrets management system.

## **The Significance of a "Break Glass" Scenario**

A "break glass" scenario is a simulated disaster that tests your organization's ability to respond to a catastrophic failure of the Vault system. These tests are essential to ensure that in the face of unexpected events, you can quickly and effectively restore the system to its normal operational state.

## **Practicing a "Break Glass" Scenario**

To practice a "break glass" scenario, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Preparation**

Before simulating a disaster, ensure that you have documented and tested the disaster recovery procedures. This includes steps for data backup and recovery, server provisioning, and resealing Vault.

**Step 2: Simulate the Disaster**

Choose a controlled environment to simulate a disaster. This might involve shutting down the Vault servers, deleting critical data, or causing a planned failure. The goal is to create a situation that requires disaster recovery.

**Step 3: Disaster Recovery**

Initiate the disaster recovery procedures. This typically involves:

- Restoring data from backups.
- Provisioning new Vault servers.
- Unsealing the new servers.
- Testing the restoration process to ensure that the Vault system is operational.

**Step 4: Post-Recovery Checks**

Once the Vault system is recovered, perform thorough post-recovery checks to ensure that all data and configurations are intact. Verify that all policies and access controls are in place and that the system is operating securely.

## **Benefits of Practicing a "Break Glass" Scenario**

Practicing a "break glass" scenario offers several advantages:

1. **Resilience**: Ensures that your Vault system can recover from disasters, maintaining business continuity.
2. **Security**: Validates that data and configurations remain secure even in the face of catastrophic failures.
3. **Compliance**: Helps meet compliance requirements that mandate disaster recovery testing.
4. **Operational Confidence**: Builds confidence in your team's ability to handle emergencies.

## **Best Practices**

When practicing a "break glass" scenario in Vault, consider these best practices:

1. **Scheduled Tests**: Schedule regular "break glass" tests to ensure that your disaster recovery procedures remain effective.
2. **Documentation**: Document the results and lessons learned from each test, updating your procedures as needed.
3. **Team Training**: Ensure that your team is trained in disaster recovery procedures and can execute them effectively.
4. **Data Security**: Safeguard the data used for testing, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed.

## **Conclusion**

Practicing a "break glass" scenario is a crucial aspect of ensuring the resilience, security, and compliance of your secrets management system. It helps you prepare for unexpected disasters and provides the confidence that you can recover from any catastrophic failure.
