# Task 11: Implement a Canary deployment strategy using ArgoCD in conjunction with tools like Flagger.

Canary deployments are a deployment strategy that allows you to test a new version of your application with a small subset of users before rolling it out to the entire user base. ArgoCD, in conjunction with tools like Flagger, provides a powerful solution for implementing Canary deployments in a GitOps workflow. In this article, we will guide you through the process of setting up a Canary deployment strategy using ArgoCD and Flagger.

### **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **ArgoCD Installed**: Make sure ArgoCD is correctly installed on your Kubernetes cluster.
2. **Git Repository**: You should have a Git repository containing the Kubernetes manifests for your application.
3. **Application Ready for Canary Deployment**: Prepare your application for a Canary deployment. This includes having two sets of resources (e.g., pods, services, ingress) for the existing version (baseline) and the new version (canary).
4. **Flagger Installed**: Install Flagger on your Kubernetes cluster. You can follow the Flagger installation guide for your specific Kubernetes environment.

### **Implementing a Canary Deployment with ArgoCD and Flagger**

Follow these steps to implement a Canary deployment using ArgoCD and Flagger:

**Step 1: Clone the Git Repository**

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Clone the Git repository containing your application's manifests to your local machine. Replace **`<repository-url>`** with the actual URL of your Git repository.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

1. Navigate to the directory where your application manifests are located.

**Step 2: Create a New Application Directory for Canary Deployment**

1. In your local Git repository directory, create a new directory for the canary version of your application. For example, you can create a directory called "my-app-canary."
2. In this new directory, create or copy the Kubernetes manifests for the canary version. These manifests should have distinct labels or names to differentiate them from the baseline version.

**Step 3: Commit and Push the Changes**

1. In your terminal, commit the changes you made to your Git repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepared the canary version of the application"
```

1. Push the changes to your remote repository:

```bash
git push origin main
```

Replace **`main`** with the branch name in your repository if it's different.

**Step 4: Create a New ArgoCD Application for Canary Deployment**

1. Open the ArgoCD dashboard in your web browser.
2. In the "Applications" tab, click the "New App" button.
3. Fill in the application details for the canary deployment:
    - **Application Name**: Choose a name for the canary deployment, e.g., "my-app-canary."
    - **Project**: Select the project you used for the baseline deployment.
    - **Source**: Set the repository URL, path (the directory for the canary version), and target revision.
    - **Destination**: Specify the target Kubernetes namespace.
    - **Sync Policy**: Set the sync policy for your canary deployment.
    - **Auto-Sync**: You can configure the synchronization process as needed.
4. Click the "Create" button to add the canary deployment application.

**Step 5: Integrate Flagger for Canary Deployment**

1. Install Flagger on your Kubernetes cluster if you haven't already.
2. Create a Flagger canary custom resource definition (CRD) for your application. This CRD defines the canary deployment strategy and metrics that Flagger will use for analysis.
3. Apply the Flagger canary CRD to your cluster.
4. Create a Flagger canary resource for your application, specifying the baseline and canary deployments, and other configuration parameters.

**Step 6: Monitor and Configure Canary Analysis**

1. Monitor the canary deployment and analysis progress by accessing the Flagger dashboard or using command-line tools.
2. Configure the criteria and metrics that Flagger will use to decide whether the canary deployment is successful.

**Step 7: Verify and Promote the Canary Deployment**

1. After the canary analysis indicates that the deployment is successful, you can promote the canary version to become the baseline.
2. Monitor the synchronization status in ArgoCD and Flagger as you promote the canary deployment.

**Step 8: Continuous Monitoring**

1. Continue to monitor and maintain the canary deployment with ArgoCD and Flagger, making updates and adjustments as needed.

### **Conclusion**

Implementing a Canary deployment strategy using ArgoCD in conjunction with Flagger is a robust way to ensure a safe and controlled rollout of new versions of your application. Canary deployments allow you to gradually introduce changes to your user base, reduce the risk of problems, and ensure a smooth user experience.
