# Task 9: Create a Grafana dashboard to visualize Prometheus metrics.

In Task 8, we explored the main features of the Grafana dashboard. Now, in Task 9, we'll take a practical approach and guide you through creating a Grafana dashboard to visualize Prometheus metrics. This hands-on exercise will help you understand how to craft informative and visually appealing dashboards for monitoring your infrastructure.

### **Prerequisites:**

Before we begin, ensure you have:

1. Grafana installed, connected to your Prometheus instance, and configured as explained in Task 7.
2. A basic understanding of the Prometheus metrics you want to visualize.

### **Creating a Grafana Dashboard:**

Follow these steps to create a Grafana dashboard and visualize Prometheus metrics:

1. **Access the Grafana Dashboard:**
    
    Open your web browser and navigate to the Grafana web interface. By default, Grafana is available at **`http://localhost:3000`**. Log in using your credentials.
    
2. **Create a New Dashboard:**
    
    From the Grafana home page, click the "+" icon next to "Home" and select "Dashboard."
    
3. **Add a New Panel:**
    
    In your new dashboard, click the "Add new panel" button.
    
4. **Configure Data Source:**
    
    In the panel editor, locate the "Data Source" section. Choose your Prometheus data source from the dropdown menu. This ensures that the panel will fetch data from Prometheus.
    
5. **Write a PromQL Query:**
    
    In the panel editor, you'll find the "Query" section. Here, you can write PromQL queries to fetch data from Prometheus. Use the query builder or write your own query. For example, you can create a query to display the CPU usage metric for a specific server:
    
    ```
    rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="user"}[5m])
    ```
    
    This query fetches the CPU usage metric for the "user" mode.
    
6. **Choose Visualization Type:**
    
    In the "Display" section, you can select the visualization type that best represents your data. Grafana offers a range of options, including time series graphs, gauges, heatmaps, and more.
    
7. **Customize Panel Settings:**
    
    You can further customize the panel by adjusting settings in the "General," "Axes," and "Legend" sections. These settings allow you to control the appearance and behavior of the panel.
    
8. **Add Additional Panels:**
    
    If you want to visualize multiple metrics on the same dashboard, click the "Add new panel" button and follow the same steps for each panel.
    
9. **Time Range Selector:**
    
    In the top right corner of the dashboard, you can use the time range selector to specify the duration for which you want to view data.
    
10. **Save the Dashboard:**
    
    Once you've configured your panels, click the "Save" icon at the top and provide a meaningful name for your dashboard.
    
11. **View Your Dashboard:**
    
    You can now access your newly created dashboard from the Grafana home page. Click on the dashboard name to view the visualizations of your Prometheus metrics.
    
12. **Share and Collaborate:**
    
    Grafana provides options for sharing and collaborating on your dashboard. You can create shareable links, export the dashboard as JSON, and even embed panels or dashboards in other web pages.
    

Conclusion:

Creating a Grafana dashboard to visualize Prometheus metrics is a valuable skill for monitoring your infrastructure. In this article, we walked through the process of creating a dashboard, configuring data sources, writing PromQL queries, choosing visualization types, customizing panel settings, and saving and sharing the dashboard.

With this knowledge, you can build custom dashboards tailored to your specific monitoring needs. In the upcoming tasks, we will delve into advanced visualization techniques and explore setting up alerts to proactively address issues in your systems.
