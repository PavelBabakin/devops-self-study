# Task 9: Define a multi-resource CloudFormation stack, including dependencies between resources.

AWS CloudFormation empowers developers to define, manage, and provision AWS resources in a structured and automated manner. When dealing with complex applications, defining a multi-resource CloudFormation stack that manages dependencies between resources becomes crucial. In this guide, we will explore how to define a CloudFormation stack with multiple resources and manage dependencies between them.

**Step 1: Understanding Resource Dependencies**

1. **What are Resource Dependencies?**
    - Dependencies arise when one AWS resource relies on another for its configuration or existence.
2. **Why Manage Dependencies?**
    - Ensuring resources are created and deleted in the correct order.
    - Avoiding failures due to missing dependencies.

**Step 2: Basic Multi-Resource CloudFormation Template**

Let’s create a basic template that defines an Amazon S3 bucket and an AWS Lambda function, where the Lambda function is triggered when an object is uploaded to the S3 bucket.

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Description: A CloudFormation template defining an S3 bucket and a Lambda function.

Resources:
  MyS3Bucket:
    Type: 'AWS::S3::Bucket'

  MyLambdaFunction:
    Type: 'AWS::Lambda::Function'
    Properties:
      Handler: index.handler
      Role: arn:aws:iam::[Your-Account-Id]:role/execution_role
      FunctionName: MySampleFunction
      Code:
        S3Bucket: [Your-Code-Bucket]
        S3Key: code/myLambdaFunction.zip
      Runtime: nodejs14.x
```

---

**Step 3: Managing Dependencies Using “DependsOn”**

The **`DependsOn`** attribute helps manage dependencies between resources. It ensures that the specified resource is created only after the resources it depends on are created.

Example: Ensure **`MyLambdaFunction`** is created after **`MyS3Bucket`**.

```yaml

  MyLambdaFunction:
    Type: 'AWS::Lambda::Function'
    DependsOn: MyS3Bucket
    Properties:
      ...
```

---

**Step 4: Creating an S3 Event Notification**

Define an S3 bucket event notification to trigger the Lambda function upon object creation.

```yaml

  MyBucketPolicy:
    Type: 'AWS::S3::BucketPolicy'
    Properties:
      PolicyDocument:
        Id: MyBucketPolicy
        Version: '2012-10-17'
        Statement:
          - Sid: LambdaInvoke
            Effect: Allow
            Principal:
              Service: s3.amazonaws.com
            Action:
              - "s3:PutObject"
            Resource:
              - !Sub 'arn:aws:s3:::${MyS3Bucket}/*'
            Condition:
              ArnLike:
                "aws:SourceArn": !GetAtt MyLambdaFunction.Arn
      Bucket: !Ref MyS3Bucket
```

---

**Step 5: Integrating Resources with AWS Lambda Permissions**

Define permissions to allow S3 to trigger the Lambda function.

```yaml

  MyLambdaInvokePermission:
    Type: 'AWS::Lambda::Permission'
    Properties:
      Action: 'lambda:InvokeFunction'
      FunctionName: !GetAtt [MyLambdaFunction, Arn]
      Principal: s3.amazonaws.com
      SourceAccount: !Sub '${AWS::AccountId}'
      SourceArn: !GetAtt [MyS3Bucket, Arn]
```

---

**Step 6: Deploying and Validating the Multi-Resource Stack**

1. **Deploying the Stack:**
    - Use AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to deploy the CloudFormation template.
2. **Validating the Stack:**
    - Validate by uploading a file to the S3 bucket and checking if the Lambda function is triggered.

**Conclusion**

Defining a multi-resource AWS CloudFormation stack and managing dependencies between resources ensures a structured and reliable provisioning of AWS resources. By understanding how to define dependencies, create event notifications, and manage resource interactions, developers can create robust and interconnected AWS environments using CloudFormation.
