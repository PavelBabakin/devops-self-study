# Task 14: Deploy an Azure Load Balancer and attach VMs to it.

Azure Load Balancer is a Layer 4 (TCP, UDP) load balancer that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed with too much traffic. It's a crucial component for enhancing the availability and reliability of applications. In this guide, we will explore how to deploy an Azure Load Balancer and attach Virtual Machines (VMs) to it, ensuring high availability and reliability of your applications.

**Step 1: Creating a Load Balancer**

- **Navigate to Load Balancers**: From the Azure Portal, click on “Create a resource”, and select “Load Balancer”.
- **Basics**: Configure the basic settings, including subscription, resource group, name, and region.
- **Type and SKU**: Choose the type (Public or Internal) and SKU (Standard or Basic) of the Load Balancer.
- **Public IP Address**: Define the public IP address settings.
- **Review + Create**: Review your configurations and click “Create” to deploy the Load Balancer.

**Step 2: Creating a Backend Pool**

- **Navigate to the Load Balancer**: Once created, go to the Load Balancer you just created.
- **Backend Pools**: Click on “Backend pools” in the left navigation.
- **Add**: Click on “Add” and configure the backend pool settings, including name and associated network IP configurations or virtual network.
- **Add VMs**: Add VMs to the backend pool by selecting them under “Associated network IP configurations”.
- **Add**: Click “Add” to create the backend pool.

**Step 3: Configuring Health Probes**

- **Health Probes**: Click on “Health probes” in the left navigation.
- **Add**: Click on “Add” and configure the health probe settings, including name, protocol, port, and interval.
- **Add**: Click “Add” to create the health probe.

**Step 4: Setting Up Load Balancing Rules**

- **Load Balancing Rules**: Click on “Load balancing rules” in the left navigation.
- **Add**: Click on “Add” and configure the rule settings, including name, IP version, frontend IP address, backend pool, health probe, and session persistence.
- **Add**: Click “Add” to create the load balancing rule.

**Step 5: Validating the Load Balancer**

- **Overview**: Navigate to the “Overview” section of the Load Balancer to view its status and settings.
- **Testing**: Ensure the Load Balancer is distributing traffic among the VMs in the backend pool by accessing the public IP address and observing the responses.

**Conclusion**

Deploying an Azure Load Balancer and attaching VMs to it enhances the availability and reliability of your applications by distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers. This ensures that no single server bears too much load, thereby maintaining optimal performance and user experience. As we continue to explore Azure, our subsequent guides will delve into more advanced functionalities and best practices in cloud computing. Stay tuned for more hands-on tasks and insights!
