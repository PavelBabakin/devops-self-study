# Task 9: Use docker-compose up and docker-compose down to start and stop multi-container applications.

After crafting a **`docker-compose.yml`** file to define our multi-container application, the next step is to manage the lifecycle of the application using Docker Compose commands. In this article, we will explore how to utilize **`docker-compose up`** and **`docker-compose down`** to start and stop multi-container applications, ensuring smooth deployment and teardown of our services.

### Docker Compose Commands

Docker Compose provides a set of commands that assist in managing the lifecycle and interaction of containers defined in a **`docker-compose.yml`** file.

### **`docker-compose up`**

This command is used to start up your application as defined in the **`docker-compose.yml`** file.

### Basic Usage:

```
docker-compose up
```

### Options:

- **`d`**: Run containers in the background (detached mode).
    
    ```
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    
- **`-build`**: Build images before starting containers.
    
    ```
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    
- **`-scale`**: Scale particular services by specifying the desired number of containers.
    
    ```
    docker-compose up --scale service_name=number_of_containers
    ```
    

### **`docker-compose down`**

This command is used to stop and remove containers, networks, images, and volumes defined in the **`docker-compose.yml`** file.

### Basic Usage:

```
docker-compose down
```

### Options:

- **`-volumes`** or **`v`**: Remove the volumes defined in **`docker-compose.yml`**.
    
    ```
    docker-compose down --volumes
    ```
    
- **`-rmi`**: Remove images used by the defined services.
    
    ```
    docker-compose down --rmi all
    ```
    
- **`-remove-orphans`**: Remove containers for services not defined in the **`docker-compose.yml`**.
    
    ```
    docker-compose down --remove-orphans
    ```

### Workflow Example

### **Starting the Application**

To start the application defined in your **`docker-compose.yml`** file, navigate to the directory containing the file and execute:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start the containers in detached mode, allowing you to use the terminal for other commands.

### **Stopping the Application**

To stop the application and remove containers, networks, and volumes, use:

```
docker-compose down -v
```

This ensures a clean state and removes any data stored in the volumes.

### Conclusion

Understanding and utilizing **`docker-compose up`** and **`docker-compose down`** is fundamental in managing the lifecycle of multi-container Docker applications. These commands provide a straightforward way to deploy, scale, and dismantle your applications, ensuring a smooth and consistent workflow.
