**Step 3: Navigating to Cloud Functions**

1. **Accessing Cloud Functions:**
    - In the Google Cloud Console, click on the navigation menu (three horizontal lines) in the upper-left corner.
    - Navigate to “Compute” and select “Cloud Functions.”
2. **Understanding the Cloud Functions Dashboard:**
    - **Dashboard:** View the summary of your Cloud Functions.
    - **Functions:** Manage individual functions, view details, and access logs.
    - **Triggers:** Understand various triggers that can invoke your functions.
    - **Logs:** Access logs generated by your functions.

**Step 4: Grasping Cloud Functions Concepts**

1. **Functions and Triggers:**
    - Functions contain your executable code, while triggers define how a function is invoked.
2. **Scaling and Hosting:**
    - Cloud Functions automatically scale based on demand and are fully managed, freeing you from server management.
3. **Runtime Environments:**
    - Explore different runtime environments and languages supported by Cloud Functions (e.g., Node.js, Python, Go).

**Step 5: Exploring GCP Free Tier**

1. **Free Tier Usage:**
    - GCP’s Free Tier includes free usage of Cloud Functions, including a generous allowance of free invocations per month.
2. **Monitoring Usage:**
    - Utilize the GCP Console to keep track of your usage and ensure that you stay within the Free Tier limits to avoid additional charges.
