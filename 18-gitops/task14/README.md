# Task 14: Secure your ArgoCD instance using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

Security is a critical aspect of any DevOps and GitOps workflow. Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in ArgoCD helps you secure your instance by defining who can access and manage applications. In this article, we will guide you through the process of securing your ArgoCD instance with RBAC.

### **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **ArgoCD Installed**: Make sure ArgoCD is correctly installed on your Kubernetes cluster.
2. **Kubernetes Cluster**: You should have a Kubernetes cluster where ArgoCD is deployed.

### **Securing Your ArgoCD Instance with RBAC**

Follow these steps to secure your ArgoCD instance using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

**Step 1: Access the Kubernetes Cluster**

1. Access your Kubernetes cluster using **`kubectl`** or a Kubernetes management tool.

**Step 2: Create a Custom Role**

1. Create a custom role that defines what actions users or groups can perform within ArgoCD. For example, you can create a role named "argo-app-admin" to provide admin-level access to ArgoCD applications.
2. Define rules in the role that specify the resources (e.g., applications, applicationsets) and the allowed actions (e.g., create, read, update, delete).

**Step 3: Create a Role Binding**

1. Create a role binding that associates the custom role you created with a user or group. This step assigns the defined role to specific users or groups within the Kubernetes cluster.
2. For example, you can create a role binding named "argo-app-admin-binding" and associate it with a user or group, giving them admin-level access to ArgoCD applications.

**Step 4: Secure the ArgoCD API Server**

1. Access the ArgoCD API Server deployment configuration in your Kubernetes cluster.
2. Edit the deployment configuration to include the following environment variable, which tells ArgoCD to use RBAC:

```yaml
- name: ARGOCD_RBAC
  value: "on"
```

1. Save the changes and update the deployment.

**Step 5: Log in with RBAC Credentials**

1. After configuring RBAC, users or groups with RBAC credentials must log in to ArgoCD with their RBAC-authorized credentials.
2. Users or groups with the "argo-app-admin" role, for example, will have admin-level access to ArgoCD applications.

**Step 6: Test RBAC Access**

1. Log in to the ArgoCD dashboard using RBAC-authorized credentials.
2. Verify that the RBAC settings are correctly applied by checking the level of access and permissions granted to the logged-in user.

**Step 7: Continuous Monitoring and Updates**

1. Continuously monitor and manage RBAC settings in your ArgoCD instance.
2. Make updates and adjustments as needed to ensure that only authorized users or groups can access and manage your applications.

**Step 8: Backup and Disaster Recovery**

1. Implement backup and disaster recovery strategies to ensure the safety and availability of your ArgoCD instance, including RBAC configurations.

### **Conclusion**

Securing your ArgoCD instance with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a fundamental step in ensuring that only authorized users or groups have access to your applications and resources. By following these steps, you can enhance the security of your DevOps and GitOps workflow and reduce the risk of unauthorized access and actions.
