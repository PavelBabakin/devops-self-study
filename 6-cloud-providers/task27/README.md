# Task 27: Deploy a Docker container using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) provides a managed environment for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications using Google infrastructure. It simplifies the complexities of Kubernetes management, such as logging, monitoring, and cluster management. In this guide, we will explore how to deploy a Docker container using Google Kubernetes Engine, providing a hands-on approach to container orchestration in Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

**Step 1: Navigating to Google Kubernetes Engine**

- **Access GCP Console**: Log into the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
- **Navigate to GKE**: From the navigation menu on the left, click on “Kubernetes Engine”.

**Step 2: Creating a Kubernetes Cluster**

- **Create Cluster**: Click on “Create Cluster”.
- **Configure Cluster**: Define the name, location (zone/region), and machine type for your cluster. Adjust other settings as per your use case.
- **Create**: Click on “Create” to deploy the cluster.

**Step 3: Deploying a Docker Container**

- **Prepare Docker Image**: Ensure your Docker image is available in a container registry, such as Google Container Registry (GCR) or Docker Hub.
- **Navigate to Workloads**: In the GKE menu, click on “Workloads”, then click on “Deploy”.
- **Configure Deployment**: Define the container image, new deployment name, and other optional settings like labels and namespace.
- **Deploy**: Click on “Deploy” to launch the Docker container in the GKE cluster.

**Step 4: Monitoring the Deployment**

- **View Workloads**: Navigate to “Workloads” to view the status, health, and details of your deployments.
- **Logs and Details**: Click on the deployment name to view logs, events, and details of the pods.
- **Scaling**: Adjust the number of replicas to scale the deployment up or down.

**Step 5: Exposing the Deployment**

- **Expose**: Click on the deployment name, then click on “Expose” to create a service that makes your deployment accessible.
- **Configure Service**: Define the service type (e.g., LoadBalancer), port, and other settings.
- **Expose**: Click on “Expose” to create the service and make your deployment accessible.

**Conclusion**

Deploying a Docker container using Google Kubernetes Engine provides a foundational understanding of managing and orchestrating containers in Google Cloud Platform. From creating a cluster to exposing deployments, GKE offers a robust and scalable platform for handling various container orchestration needs. As we continue to explore GCP, our subsequent guides will delve into more advanced container management practices and use-cases with GKE. Stay tuned for more hands-on tasks and insights!
