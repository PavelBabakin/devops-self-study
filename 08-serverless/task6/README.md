# Task 6: Set up an AWS account and navigate to the Lambda service.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a robust and versatile platform for deploying serverless applications through its Lambda service. AWS Lambda allows you to run your code without provisioning or managing servers, scaling automatically with the size of your workload. In this guide, we will walk through the steps to set up an AWS account and navigate to the Lambda service, paving the way for deploying your serverless functions on AWS.

**Step 1: Creating Your AWS Account**

1. **Visit AWS Website:**
    - Navigate to the [AWS official website](https://aws.amazon.com/).
2. **Sign Up Process:**
    - Click on the “Create an AWS Account” button and follow through with the sign-up process, which includes providing your email address, password, and AWS account name.
3. **Account Verification:**
    - Verify your account through email and mobile number verification.
4. **Billing Information:**
    - Provide your billing information. AWS offers a Free Tier with certain usage limits, but it’s crucial to input billing details for any usage beyond the free tier limits.

**Step 3: Navigating to AWS Lambda**

1. **Accessing Lambda:**
    - In the AWS Management Console, click on “Services” and select “Lambda” under the “Compute” section. Alternatively, use the search bar to find and navigate to the Lambda service.
2. **Understanding the Lambda Dashboard:**
    - **Functions:** View and manage your Lambda functions.
    - **Applications:** Manage applications, which are collections of AWS resources working together.
    - **Event Source Mappings:** Manage event sources that trigger your function.
    - **Layers:** Manage layers, which are custom runtimes or additional code/data that your function uses.

**Step 4: Familiarizing with AWS Lambda Concepts**

1. **Functions:**
    - Lambda functions are the core of AWS Lambda and contain your runtime and handler, which processes events.
2. **Triggers:**
    - Triggers are AWS services or resources that invoke your function in response to data modifications or user actions.
3. **Layers:**
    - Layers allow you to include additional files or data in your function, such as dependencies, libraries, or custom runtimes.

**Step 5: Exploring AWS Lambda’s Free Tier**

1. **Free Tier Usage:**
    - AWS Lambda’s Free Tier includes 1 million free requests per month and 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month.
2. **Monitoring Usage:**
    - Utilize AWS CloudWatch to monitor your usage and ensure that you stay within the Free Tier limits to avoid additional charges.
