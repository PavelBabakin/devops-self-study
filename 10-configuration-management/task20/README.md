# Task 20: Optimize your playbook runs using strategies like free or fastest.

Efficient playbook execution is crucial for ensuring that your automation tasks run smoothly and swiftly. Ansible provides various strategies to optimize playbook runs, making the most of your resources and minimizing execution time. In this article, we'll explore Ansible playbook optimization strategies like "free" and "fastest" to supercharge your automation workflows.

**Step 1: The Need for Playbook Optimization**

### **A. Playbook Execution Challenges:**

- Long playbook runtimes.
- Resource wastage during execution.
- Inefficient utilization of target hosts.

### **B. Optimization Strategies:**

- The "free" strategy.
- The "fastest" strategy.

---

**Step 2: The "Free" Strategy**

### **A. Defining the "Free" Strategy:**

The "free" strategy optimizes playbook runs by executing tasks on all hosts in parallel, making efficient use of available resources.

### **B. Implementation:**

Specify the "free" strategy in your playbook by adding the following line at the top of your playbook file:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  strategy: free
  tasks:
    - name: Your Task
      # Your task details here
```

### **C. Advantages:**

- Optimal resource utilization.
- Parallel task execution.
- Reduced playbook execution time.

**Step 3: The "Fastest" Strategy**

### **A. Defining the "Fastest" Strategy:**

The "fastest" strategy prioritizes executing tasks on the fastest available host, optimizing for speed.

### **B. Implementation:**

Specify the "fastest" strategy in your playbook by adding the following line at the top of your playbook file:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  strategy: fastest
  tasks:
    - name: Your Task
      # Your task details here
```

### **C. Advantages:**

- Reduced playbook execution time.
- Prioritizing the fastest hosts.
- Suitable for latency-sensitive tasks.

---

**Step 4: Choosing the Right Strategy**

### **A. Considerations:**

- Task dependencies.
- Resource availability.
- Latency sensitivity.

### **B. Evaluating Task Dependencies:**

Ensure that your playbook tasks are independent or can be parallelized effectively.

### **C. Resource Availability:**

Consider the number of available target hosts and their resources when selecting a strategy.

### **D. Latency Sensitivity:**

For latency-sensitive tasks, prioritize speed with the "fastest" strategy.

**Conclusion**

Optimizing Ansible playbook runs is essential for efficient automation. The "free" and "fastest" strategies offer tailored approaches to enhance playbook performance. By selecting the right strategy based on task dependencies, resource availability, and latency sensitivity, you can streamline your automation workflows, reduce execution times, and make the most of your infrastructure resources.
