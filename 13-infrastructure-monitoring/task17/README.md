# Task 17: Use Datadog's APM (Application Performance Monitoring) to trace requests across services.

In Task 16, we explored setting up alerts in Datadog to monitor metric thresholds and anomalies. In Task 17, we will dive into Application Performance Monitoring (APM) with Datadog. APM provides deep insights into your application's performance, allowing you to trace requests as they traverse your services and identify bottlenecks or performance issues.

### **Prerequisites:**

Before we begin, ensure you have:

1. A Datadog account, the Datadog agent installed on your server or local machine, and a working application or service you want to monitor.
2. Basic knowledge of the application's architecture and components.

### **Leveraging Datadog's APM for Request Tracing:**

Follow these steps to use Datadog's APM to trace requests across services:

1. **Access the Datadog Dashboard:**
    
    Log in to your Datadog account and navigate to the Datadog dashboard.
    
2. **Enable APM:**
    
    To start using APM, you need to enable it for the specific application or service you want to monitor. Follow these steps:
    
    - From the Datadog dashboard, go to the "APM" menu.
    - Click "APM Setup" to begin the configuration.
3. **Select an Application to Monitor:**
    
    In the APM setup, you'll see a list of available applications or services. Select the one you want to monitor with APM and click "Next."
    
4. **Instrument Your Code:**
    
    To trace requests effectively, you need to instrument your code. Datadog provides libraries and agents for various programming languages and frameworks. Follow the instructions to install the Datadog APM libraries for your specific environment.
    
5. **Analyze Traces:**
    
    Once your code is instrumented and running, Datadog will start collecting traces from requests as they flow through your application. You can access the traces and performance data from the APM dashboard.
    
6. **View and Analyze Traces:**
    
    In the APM dashboard, you can explore trace data to understand how requests are moving through your application. Traces provide a detailed view of the lifecycle of a request, including the time spent in different parts of your code and any external services or databases accessed.
    
7. **Identify Bottlenecks:**
    
    Use the trace data to identify performance bottlenecks, latency issues, or errors in your application. This can help you pinpoint areas of improvement and optimize your code for better performance.
    
8. **Group and Filter Traces:**
    
    Datadog APM allows you to group and filter traces based on various criteria. You can group traces by service, operation, tags, or other custom attributes. Filtering and segmenting traces make it easier to analyze specific aspects of your application.
    
9. **Set Up Alerts (Optional):**
    
    To proactively manage application performance, you can set up APM alerts. Define alert conditions that trigger notifications when your application's performance falls below acceptable levels.
    
10. **Enhance Troubleshooting:**
    
    APM traces are invaluable for troubleshooting and debugging. When issues arise, you can review traces to understand the flow of requests and identify the source of problems quickly.
    
11. **Optimize Performance:**
    
    Armed with APM insights, work on optimizing your application's performance by addressing identified bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
    
12. **Iterate and Improve:**
    
    Continuously monitor your application with Datadog APM to track improvements and ensure that your optimizations are having a positive impact on performance.
    

Conclusion:

Datadog's APM provides a comprehensive view of your application's performance by tracing requests as they move through your services. In this article, we explored the process of enabling APM for an application, instrumenting your code, and using trace data to analyze and optimize performance.

With Datadog APM, you can enhance the reliability and efficiency of your applications and ensure that your users have a seamless experience. In the upcoming tasks, we will continue to explore Datadog's advanced features and ways to further enhance your monitoring and analysis capabilities.
