# Task 2: Familiarize yourself with key concepts and terminologies used in Kubernetes.

Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration platform that comes with a rich set of concepts and terminologies. Before diving deeper into Kubernetes, it's essential to familiarize yourself with these key concepts. Understanding these fundamentals will pave the way for a smoother journey as you explore the various aspects of Kubernetes. Let's take a closer look at some of the critical concepts and terms you'll encounter in the Kubernetes ecosystem:

## **1. Pods:**

- Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. They represent a single instance of a running process within your cluster. A pod can contain one or more containers that share the same network namespace and storage.

## **2. ReplicaSets:**

- ReplicaSets are used to ensure that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. They help in achieving high availability and load balancing by maintaining a set number of identical pods.

## **3. Deployments:**

- Deployments provide declarative updates to applications, allowing you to describe an application's life cycle, such as which images to use for the app, the number of replicas, and how to update them while minimizing downtime.

## **4. Services:**

- Kubernetes Services enable network access to a set of pods, providing a stable endpoint for connecting to your application. They come in various types, including ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer, each with specific use cases.

## **5. StatefulSets:**

- StatefulSets are used for stateful applications that require stable network identities and persistent storage. Examples include databases and key-value stores.

## **6. Jobs and CronJobs:**

- Jobs manage batch processing tasks, ensuring they complete successfully. CronJobs are similar but run on a schedule, making them ideal for periodic tasks.

## **7. ConfigMaps and Secrets:**

- ConfigMaps store configuration data as key-value pairs, while Secrets store sensitive information like API tokens, passwords, or SSH keys. Both are used to decouple configuration from application code.

## **8. Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC):**

- PVs are used to provide storage resources in a cluster, while PVCs request a specific amount of storage from PVs. They ensure that storage is available to pods requiring it.

## **9. Container Runtime:**

- The container runtime is the software responsible for running containers. Docker was the original runtime used with Kubernetes, but other runtimes like containerd and CRI-O are also supported.

## **10. Kubelet:**

- Kubelet is an agent that runs on each node in the cluster and ensures that containers are running in a Pod. It communicates with the control plane and takes care of container lifecycle management.

## **11. KubeProxy:**

- KubeProxy is responsible for network proxying on each node. It maintains network rules allowing network communication to your pods from network sessions inside or outside the cluster.

## **12. KubeConfig:**

- KubeConfig is a file that specifies how to connect to a Kubernetes cluster. It contains information like the cluster's address, authentication credentials, and context settings.

## **13. Ingress:**

- Ingress resources define rules for routing external traffic to services within the cluster. They provide an HTTP and HTTPS entry point into your cluster.

## **14. Namespaces:**

- Namespaces are used to create virtual clusters within a physical cluster. They help in organizing resources and provide isolation.

## **15. API Server:**

- The API Server is the central management entity that exposes the Kubernetes API. All administrative tasks and user interactions are performed through this component.

## **16. Etcd:**

- Etcd is a distributed key-value store that stores all cluster data, ensuring data consistency and resilience.

## **17. RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):**

- RBAC is a security feature that allows fine-grained control over who can access and manipulate resources in a Kubernetes cluster.

## **18. Network Policies:**

- Network Policies define how pods are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints. They help in controlling traffic flow within the cluster.

Understanding these concepts and terms is essential as you delve into Kubernetes. They form the foundation of your knowledge and will enable you to work with Kubernetes effectively. In the next tasks, we'll explore practical exercises and hands-on experiences, allowing you to apply this knowledge and gain proficiency in Kubernetes.
