# Task 20: Explore advanced features available in the Pro or Enterprise versions, such as High Availability, Access Federation, and Smart Repositories.

In Task 20 of your DevOps journey, we'll delve into the advanced features available in JFrog Artifactory Pro or Enterprise versions. These advanced capabilities provide enhanced functionalities and performance improvements, making your DevOps workflow more efficient and robust. Let's explore some of these advanced features, including High Availability, Access Federation, and Smart Repositories.

**Prerequisites**

Before we proceed, ensure that you have:

1. Access to JFrog Artifactory Pro or Enterprise versions.
2. Familiarity with the core functionality of Artifactory.

**Exploring Advanced Features**

**High Availability (HA)**

High Availability is a critical feature in Artifactory Pro/Enterprise that ensures continuous availability and performance, even in the face of hardware or software failures. Here's how you can explore this feature:

1. **Access High Availability Configuration**: In the Artifactory dashboard, navigate to the "Admin" section and select "High Availability." This is where you'll configure HA settings.
2. **Set Up High Availability**: Follow the provided documentation or user guides to set up High Availability in your Artifactory instance. HA typically involves clustering multiple Artifactory nodes, load balancing, and configuring a shared database.
3. **Test Failover**: With HA in place, you can test failover scenarios to ensure that your Artifactory instance remains available even when one node fails.

**Access Federation**

Access Federation is a feature in Artifactory that allows you to collaborate with multiple Artifactory instances while maintaining control and access permissions. Here's how to explore this feature:

1. **Access Federation Configuration**: In the Artifactory dashboard, navigate to the "Admin" section and select "Federation."
2. **Configure Federation**: Set up federation links to connect your Artifactory instance with other Artifactory instances. You can specify the target instance's URL and define replication and access policies.
3. **Collaboration and Permissions**: Use federation to share artifacts and repositories while maintaining control over access permissions and security.

**Smart Repositories**

Smart Repositories are repositories that provide advanced features for optimizing artifact management. Here's how to explore this feature:

1. **Create Smart Repositories**: In the Artifactory dashboard, go to the "Admin" section and select "Repositories."
2. **Configure Smart Repositories**: Create and configure smart repositories to leverage features like package type-specific indexing and metadata retrieval. For example, you can set up a Docker Smart Repository to optimize Docker image handling.
3. **Custom Metadata**: Utilize custom metadata in smart repositories to enhance artifact management and search capabilities.
