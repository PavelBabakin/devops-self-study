# Task 5: Explore CDK patterns for common architectural setups, such as a serverless web application.

AWS CDK patterns are pre-built, open-source architecture patterns that can be easily deployed using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK). These patterns provide a structured and efficient way to leverage AWS services for common use cases and architectural setups, such as serverless web applications. In this guide, we will explore how to utilize AWS CDK patterns to create a serverless web application, providing insights into the seamless integration of AWS services like AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, and Amazon S3.

**Step 1: Understanding AWS CDK Patterns**

1. **What are CDK Patterns?**
    - CDK Patterns are architecture patterns that leverage AWS CDK to define and deploy AWS resources for common use cases.
2. **Benefits:**
    - Accelerate development by utilizing pre-built architectures.
    - Learn best practices for deploying AWS resources.
    - Explore various architectural setups and AWS service integrations.

**Step 2: Setting Up a Serverless Web Application**

1. **Components of a Serverless Web App:**
    - **Frontend:** Hosted on Amazon S3 and distributed via Amazon CloudFront.
    - **Backend:** AWS Lambda functions triggered by API Gateway.
2. **Using CDK Patterns:**
    - Visit the [CDK Patterns GitHub repository](https://github.com/cdk-patterns/serverless) and explore available patterns.
    - Identify a pattern that aligns with a serverless web application, such as **`The Simple Web Service`**.

---

**Step 3: Deploying a CDK Pattern**

1. **Prerequisites:**
    - Ensure AWS CDK and AWS CLI are installed and configured.
2. **Clone the CDK Patterns Repository:**
    - Clone the repository and navigate to the desired pattern:
        
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/cdk-patterns/serverless.git
        cd serverless/the-simple-web-service/typescript
        ```
        
3. **Deploy the Pattern:**
    - Install dependencies and deploy the pattern using AWS CDK:
        
        ```bash
        npm install
        cdk deploy
        ```

**Step 4: Exploring the Deployed Serverless Web Application**

1. **Understanding the Architecture:**
    - Explore the AWS Management Console to understand how the S3 bucket, Lambda functions, and API Gateway are configured and interconnected.
2. **Testing the Application:**
    - Use the provided API Gateway URL to test the serverless web application.
    - Validate the functionality of the Lambda function and API Gateway integration.

---

**Step 5: Customizing and Extending the CDK Pattern**

1. **Modifying the Lambda Function:**
    - Explore the Lambda function code and make modifications to customize the backend logic.
2. **Adjusting API Gateway:**
    - Customize the API Gateway configuration, adjusting routes, methods, and integrations as per your use case.
3. **Enhancing the Frontend:**
    - Modify the static web content hosted on S3 to customize the frontend of your serverless web application.

---

**Step 6: Clean Up and Best Practices**

1. **Destroying the Stack:**
    - Ensure to clean up the deployed resources to manage costs:
        
        ```bash
        cdk destroy
        ```
        
2. **Best Practices:**
    - Explore best practices for managing serverless applications, such as monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch, optimizing Lambda costs, and securing API Gateway.
