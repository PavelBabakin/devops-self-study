# Task 10: Implement a Blue-Green deployment strategy using ArgoCD.

In modern DevOps and GitOps practices, implementing deployment strategies that minimize downtime and reduce risks is crucial. Blue-Green deployment is one such strategy that allows you to deploy a new version of your application alongside the existing one and seamlessly switch traffic to the new version when it's ready. In this article, we will guide you through implementing a Blue-Green deployment strategy using ArgoCD.

### **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **ArgoCD Installed**: Make sure ArgoCD is correctly installed on your Kubernetes cluster.
2. **Git Repository**: You should have a Git repository containing the Kubernetes manifests for your application.
3. **Application Ready for Blue-Green Deployment**: Prepare your application for a Blue-Green deployment by having two sets of resources (e.g., pods, services, ingress) with distinct labels, one for the existing version (blue) and one for the new version (green).

### **Implementing a Blue-Green Deployment with ArgoCD**

Follow these steps to implement a Blue-Green deployment with ArgoCD:

**Step 1: Clone the Git Repository**

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Clone the Git repository containing your application's manifests to your local machine. Replace **`<repository-url>`** with the actual URL of your Git repository.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

1. Navigate to the directory where your application manifests are located.

**Step 2: Create a New Application Directory**

1. In your local Git repository directory, create a new directory for the green version of your application. For example, you can create a directory called "my-app-green."
2. In this new directory, create or copy the Kubernetes manifests for the new version of your application. These manifests should have distinct labels or names to differentiate them from the existing version.

**Step 3: Commit and Push the Changes**

1. In your terminal, commit the changes you made to your Git repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepared the green version of the application"
```

1. Push the changes to your remote repository:

```bash
git push origin main
```

Replace **`main`** with the branch name in your repository if it's different.

**Step 4: Create a New ArgoCD Application for Green Deployment**

1. Open the ArgoCD dashboard in your web browser.
2. In the "Applications" tab, click the "New App" button.
3. Fill in the application details:
    - **Application Name**: Choose a name for the green deployment, e.g., "my-app-green."
    - **Project**: Select the project you used for the blue deployment.
    - **Source**: Set the repository URL, path (the directory for the green version), and target revision.
    - **Destination**: Specify the target Kubernetes namespace.
    - **Sync Policy**: Set the sync policy for your green deployment.
    - **Auto-Sync**: You can configure the synchronization process as needed.
4. Click the "Create" button to add the green deployment application.

**Step 5: Sync the Green Deployment**

1. After adding the green deployment application, click the "Sync" button to initiate the synchronization process.
2. ArgoCD will automatically deploy the green version of your application to the Kubernetes cluster.

**Step 6: Test and Verify the Green Deployment**

1. Test the green deployment to ensure it is running correctly and meets your quality criteria.
2. Monitor the green deployment's synchronization status on the ArgoCD dashboard.

**Step 7: Promote the Green Deployment to Blue-Green**

1. When you are satisfied that the green deployment is stable and ready to serve production traffic, initiate the switch from blue to green.
2. To do this, you can update the Kubernetes resources for your services or ingress to direct traffic to the green version. Make sure to test the change thoroughly in a staging environment before applying it to the production environment.
3. Monitor the synchronization status in ArgoCD as you make these changes.

**Step 8: Verify the Blue-Green Deployment**

1. After completing the switch, verify that the blue-green deployment is working as expected.
2. Monitor the synchronization status in ArgoCD to ensure that both blue and green deployments remain stable.

**Step 9: Clean Up**

1. Once you are confident that the green deployment is successful and there are no issues with the blue-green setup, you can remove the blue version of your application from the Kubernetes cluster. You can also remove the blue deployment directory from your Git repository if you no longer need it.

**Step 10: Continuous Monitoring**

1. Continue to monitor and maintain the blue-green deployment with ArgoCD, making updates and adjustments as needed.

### **Conclusion**

Implementing a Blue-Green deployment strategy with ArgoCD is a powerful way to minimize downtime and reduce risks during application updates. By following these steps, you can ensure a smooth transition from the old version (blue) to the new version (green) of your application. This approach enhances the reliability and availability of your services in a GitOps workflow.
