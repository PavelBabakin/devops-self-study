# Task 16: Set up SSH access on a Linux machine and connect to it from a remote machine.

Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol used for secure communication between systems over an unsecured network. SSH is widely used to access remote servers securely, manage them, and transfer files. In this guide, we will explore how to set up SSH access on a Linux machine and connect to it from a remote machine.

**Prerequisites**

- A Linux machine with internet access
- Basic understanding of terminal commands
- A remote machine with SSH client installed

**Step 1: Installing the SSH Server**

1. **Update System Packages**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
    ```
    
2. **Install OpenSSH Server**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install openssh-server
    ```
    
3. **Verify SSH Service**:Ensure the SSH service is active and running.
    
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status ssh
    ```
    

**Step 2: Configuring SSH**

1. **Navigate to SSH Config**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    ```
    
2. **Configure SSH**:
    - **Port**: Specify the port number (default is 22).
    - **PermitRootLogin**: Determine whether the root user can log in (recommended: no).
    - **PasswordAuthentication**: Decide whether password authentication is allowed.
3. **Restart SSH Service**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart ssh
    ```
    

**Step 3: Connecting to the SSH Server**

From a remote machine:

1. **Using Password Authentication**:
    
    ```bash
    ssh [username]@[server_ip_address]
    ```
    
    Replace **`[username]`** with the user you wish to log in as and **`[server_ip_address]`** with the IP address of the SSH server.
    
2. **Using Key-Based Authentication**:
    - **Generate SSH Key Pair** (on the client machine):
        
        ```bash
        ssh-keygen
        ```
        
    - **Copy Public Key to Server**:
        
        ```bash
        ssh-copy-id [username]@[server_ip_address]
        ```
        
    - **Connect to Server**:
        
        ```bash
        ssh [username]@[server_ip_address]
        ```
        

**Step 4: Ensuring Secure SSH Connections**

- **Use Strong Passwords**: Ensure all user accounts have strong, unique passwords.
- **Use Key-Based Authentication**: Prefer SSH key pairs over passwords for enhanced security.
- **Change Default SSH Port**: Altering the default port (22) can deter basic attacks.
- **Use SSH Config Files**: Utilize **`~/.ssh/config`** to manage multiple SSH connections efficiently.

**Conclusion**

Successfully setting up and accessing SSH on a Linux machine enables secure, encrypted communications and management of remote servers. SSH is a fundamental skill for system administrators, developers, and any IT professionals managing servers or networked systems.
