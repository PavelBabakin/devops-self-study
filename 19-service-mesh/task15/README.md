# Task 15: Use Istio's authentication and authorization features to secure your services.

In Task 15 of the DevOps Engineer's Service Mesh learning program, we will focus on using Istio's authentication and authorization features to secure your services. Istio provides powerful tools for controlling and securing service-to-service communication, ensuring that only authorized services can access one another.

**Prerequisites**

Before proceeding, ensure you have Istio installed and a good understanding of the Istio service mesh, mutual TLS (mTLS), and the basics of service security.

**Understanding Authentication and Authorization in Istio**

- **Authentication:** Istio offers multiple authentication methods, including mTLS and JWT (JSON Web Tokens). With mTLS, services authenticate each other using certificates. JWT authentication allows services to verify the identity of incoming requests based on a token.
- **Authorization:** Once services are authenticated, you can use Istio's authorization policies to specify who is allowed to access your services. This is achieved using the **`AuthorizationPolicy`** resource.

**Step 1: Authentication with mTLS**

Istio provides mutual TLS (mTLS) for service authentication, which we've previously configured. When mTLS is enabled, services within the mesh automatically authenticate each other using certificates.

To verify that mTLS is in place and providing authentication, follow these steps:

1. List the pods in your sample application:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n sample-app
```

1. Describe one of the pods to view its Istio proxy configuration:

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n sample-app
```

You should see that Istio's mTLS is enabled, and the proxy container uses certificates for secure communication.

**Step 2: Authorization with `AuthorizationPolicy`**

Authorization in Istio is managed using the **`AuthorizationPolicy`** resource. Let's create a simple example of an **`AuthorizationPolicy`** that restricts access to the httpbin service.

1. Create a file named **`authorization-policy.yaml`** with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: httpbin-policy
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: httpbin
  action: ALLOW
  rules:
  - from:
    - source:
        notRequestPrincipals: ["*"]
```

In this example, the **`AuthorizationPolicy`** allows access to the httpbin service only if there is a valid request principal. The **`notRequestPrincipals`** field is set to **`["*"]`**, which means any valid principal is allowed.

1. Apply the **`AuthorizationPolicy`** to your cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -n sample-app -f authorization-policy.yaml
```

**Conclusion**

Utilizing Istio's authentication and authorization features enhances the security of your services, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized services can access your resources. By employing mutual TLS (mTLS) for authentication and creating authorization policies with **`AuthorizationPolicy`**, you have fine-grained control over who can communicate with your services.

As you continue your DevOps journey, consider refining your security policies to restrict access based on specific criteria, such as user identities or request properties. Stay vigilant in monitoring and managing the security aspects of your service mesh for a robust and secure microservices environment.

In upcoming tasks, we will explore more advanced features and security aspects of Istio and service mesh management. Stay tuned for further practical guides and insights.
