# Task 14: Use Pulumi's programming model to create dynamic infrastructure setups, like loops for resource creation.

Pulumi’s Infrastructure as Code (IaC) platform allows developers to utilize general-purpose programming languages to define and manage cloud resources. This capability enables the creation of dynamic and programmatically-driven infrastructure setups. In this guide, we will explore how to use Pulumi’s programming model to create dynamic infrastructure setups, such as using loops for resource creation.

---

**Step 1: Understanding Pulumi’s Programming Model**

- **General-Purpose Languages:** Pulumi supports TypeScript, Python, Go, and .NET for defining infrastructure.
- **Programmatic Infrastructure:** Leverage programming constructs like loops, conditionals, and functions to define resources dynamically.

**Step 2: Setting Up a Pulumi Project**

Ensure you have a Pulumi project set up and configured. If not, refer to previous guides to initialize a Pulumi project with your preferred programming language.

**Step 3: Dynamic Resource Creation with Loops**

### **Example: Creating Multiple Azure Storage Accounts**

1. **Importing Pulumi Azure Package:**
Ensure the Pulumi Azure package is installed and imported in your project file.
2. **Using Loops for Resource Creation:**
Utilize loops to create multiple instances of a resource. Below is an example using TypeScript:

```tsx
import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";

// Define an array of storage account names
const storageAccountNames = ["store1", "store2", "store3"];

// Loop through the array and create a storage account for each name
storageAccountNames.forEach((name, index) => {
    new azure.storage.Account(`mystorageaccount${index}`, {
        resourceGroupName: azure.core.getResourceGroup().name,
        accountTier: "Standard",
        accountReplicationType: "LRS",
    });
});
```

**Step 4: Managing Dynamic Resource Properties**

### **Example: Assigning Unique Properties to Resources**

- **Dynamic Naming:** Use variables and string interpolation to assign unique names to resources.
- **Conditional Properties:** Utilize conditionals to assign properties based on specific criteria.

```tsx
storageAccountNames.forEach((name, index) => {
    new azure.storage.Account(`mystorageaccount${index}`, {
        resourceGroupName: azure.core.getResourceGroup().name,
        accountTier: index === 0 ? "Premium" : "Standard", // Conditional property assignment
        accountReplicationType: "LRS",
    });
});
```

---

**Step 5: Managing Dependencies Between Dynamic Resources**

- **Resource Dependencies:** Ensure that dependent resources are created in the correct order.
- **Output Values:** Use the output properties of resources to configure dependencies.

### **Example: Creating Blob Containers in Each Storage Account**

```tsx
storageAccountNames.forEach((name, index) => {
    const storageAccount = new azure.storage.Account(`mystorageaccount${index}`, {
        resourceGroupName: azure.core.getResourceGroup().name,
        accountTier: "Standard",
        accountReplicationType: "LRS",
    });

    // Create a blob container in each storage account
    new azure.storage.Container(`mycontainer${index}`, {
        storageAccountName: storageAccount.name,
        containerAccessType: "private",
    });
});
```
