# Task 3: Set up SSH access for each system.

Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol used for secure communication over an unsecured network. For DevOps engineers and system administrators, SSH is an indispensable tool for remote system management. In this guide, we'll walk through the steps to set up SSH access for Ubuntu/Debian, FreeBSD, and CentOS/Fedora.

**1. Installing SSH**:
Before setting up SSH access, ensure that the SSH server is installed on each system.

- **Ubuntu/Debian**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install openssh-server
    ```
    
- **FreeBSD**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo pkg install openssh-portable
    ```
    
- **CentOS/Fedora**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo yum install openssh-server
    ```
    

**2. Starting and Enabling the SSH Service**:

- **Ubuntu/Debian & CentOS/Fedora**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start sshd
    sudo systemctl enable sshd
    ```
    
- **FreeBSD**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo service sshd start
    echo 'sshd_enable="YES"' | sudo tee -a /etc/rc.conf
    ```
    

**3. Configuring SSH**:
The main configuration file for SSH is located at **`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`**. It's advisable to backup this file before making changes.

- **Permit Root Login**: For security reasons, it's recommended to disable root login via SSH. Find the line **`PermitRootLogin`** and set it to **`no`**.
- **Password Authentication**: To enhance security, you can disable password authentication and use SSH keys instead. Set **`PasswordAuthentication`** to **`no`**.

**4. Setting Up SSH Key Authentication**:
SSH keys offer a more secure way of logging in compared to passwords.

- On your local machine, generate an SSH key pair:
    
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen
    ```
    
- Copy the public key to the server:
    
    ```bash
    ssh-copy-id username@server_ip_address
    ```
    

**5. Testing SSH Access**:
From your local machine, try accessing the server:

```bash
ssh username@server_ip_address
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to log in without entering a password.

**6. Additional Security Measures**:

- **Change the Default Port**: To reduce the risk of automated attacks, consider changing the default SSH port from 22 to a higher number.
- **Use Fail2Ban**: This is a log-parsing application that protects Linux virtual machines from malicious login attempts.

**Conclusion**:
Setting up SSH access is a fundamental step in managing and securing remote systems. With SSH, you can confidently and securely execute commands, transfer files, and perform other administrative tasks. This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough for Ubuntu/Debian, FreeBSD, and CentOS/Fedora. As always, remember that security is an ongoing process, and it's essential to stay updated with best practices and software patches.
