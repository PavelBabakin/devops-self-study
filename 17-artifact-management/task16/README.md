# Task 16: Implement cleanup policies to remove old or unused artifacts.

Task 16 of your DevOps journey focuses on implementing cleanup policies in JFrog Artifactory. Cleanup policies are essential for maintaining a tidy artifact repository, as they help remove old or unused artifacts that may no longer be needed. Efficient artifact management not only saves storage space but also improves performance and simplifies the DevOps workflow. Let's explore the process of implementing cleanup policies in Artifactory.

**Prerequisites**

Before we proceed, ensure that you have:

1. Successfully installed and configured JFrog Artifactory.
2. Access to the Artifactory dashboard.

**Implementing Cleanup Policies**

**Step 1: Access the Cleanup Policy Configuration**

1. **Access the Artifactory Dashboard**: Log in to the Artifactory dashboard using your web browser.
2. **Navigate to the Admin Section**: Click on the "Admin" tab in the left sidebar.
3. **Cleanup Configuration**: In the "Advanced" section, select "Cleanup Configuration."

**Step 2: Create a Cleanup Policy**

1. **Create a New Cleanup Policy**: Click the "New" button to create a new cleanup policy.
2. **Define Cleanup Rules**: In the cleanup policy configuration, you can define rules for which artifacts should be cleaned up. Rules typically involve criteria such as age, last accessed time, or number of versions to keep.
    - **Age-Based Cleanup**: You can specify a retention period, and artifacts older than this period will be removed.
    - **Unused Artifacts**: You can define rules to remove artifacts that have not been accessed or downloaded within a specific timeframe.
    - **Version Cleanup**: You can set rules to limit the number of versions to keep for a specific artifact.
3. **Apply Cleanup Policy to Repositories**: Choose the repositories to which the cleanup policy should be applied. You can select one or multiple repositories.
4. **Save the Cleanup Policy**: Click the "Save" button to create the cleanup policy.

**Step 3: Monitor Cleanup Execution**

1. **Execution Schedule**: Cleanup policies can be configured to run on a schedule, such as daily, weekly, or monthly. You can specify the execution schedule based on your needs.
2. **View Cleanup Logs**: You can view the cleanup logs to monitor the artifacts that were removed based on the policy.

**Use Cases and Benefits**

- **Optimized Storage**: Cleanup policies help you free up storage space by removing old or unused artifacts, ensuring efficient storage utilization.
- **Improved Performance**: A cleaner repository leads to improved performance in artifact retrieval and management.
- **Version Control**: Cleanup policies allow you to control the number of versions for a particular artifact, ensuring that you maintain only the required versions.
- **Automation**: Cleanup policies can be automated to run at scheduled intervals, reducing manual maintenance efforts.
- **Compliance**: Cleanup policies help you comply with data retention policies and ensure that outdated or unnecessary artifacts are removed.

Conclusion

Implementing cleanup policies in JFrog Artifactory is crucial for maintaining an efficient and organized artifact repository. Cleanup policies help optimize storage, improve performance, and simplify the DevOps workflow by removing old or unused artifacts. In the next tasks, we'll continue to explore advanced DevOps actions, including integrating Artifactory with CI/CD tools, automating artifact deployment as part of the CI/CD pipeline, and exploring advanced features available in the Pro or Enterprise versions.
