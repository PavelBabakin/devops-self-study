Hello, dear readers! Today, we're embarking on a journey into the world of Vim, one of the most powerful and revered text editors in the Unix ecosystem. Vim, being a modal editor, has a steep learning curve, but once mastered, it offers unparalleled efficiency. Let's start by installing Vim and then exploring the built-in **`vimtutor`** to get a grasp of its basics.

Once installed, you can open Vim by typing **`vim`** in the terminal.
