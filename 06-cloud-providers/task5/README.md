# Task 5: Deploy a load balancer (ELB) and attach EC2 instances to it.

Ensuring that your application is always available and efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers is crucial in a cloud environment. AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, in one or more availability zones. In this guide, we will explore how to deploy an Elastic Load Balancer and attach EC2 instances to it, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance in your applications.

**Step 1: Deploying an Elastic Load Balancer**

- **Navigate to EC2**: From the AWS Management Console, click on “Services” and select “EC2”.
- **Load Balancers**: In the EC2 dashboard, click on “Load Balancers” in the left navigation pane.
- **Create Load Balancer**: Click on the “Create Load Balancer” button.
- **Choose a Load Balancer Type**: Select the type of load balancer that suits your needs (Application Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer, or Classic Load Balancer) and click “Create”.
- **Configure Load Balancer**: Assign a name, choose a scheme (internet-facing or internal), and configure listeners and availability zones.
- **Configure Security Settings**: Choose an SSL certificate and configure security policies.
- **Configure Security Groups**: Assign a security group to your load balancer.
- **Configure Routing**: Define a target group and configure health checks.
- **Register Targets**: Add the EC2 instances you want to manage with the load balancer.
- **Review and Create**: Confirm your configurations and click “Create”.

**Step 2: Verifying the Load Balancer**

- **Load Balancer State**: Once created, check the state of the load balancer to ensure it’s active.
- **Testing**: Use the DNS name provided by the load balancer to send traffic and ensure it’s being distributed to the registered targets.

**Step 3: Monitoring the Load Balancer**

- **CloudWatch Metrics**: Navigate to the “Monitoring” tab in the Load Balancers dashboard to view CloudWatch metrics, which provide insights into the performance of your load balancer.
- **Access Logs**: Enable access logs to capture detailed information about requests sent to your load balancer and store them in Amazon S3.
- **Request Tracing**: Use request tracing to track HTTP requests from clients to targets.

**Conclusion**

Deploying an Elastic Load Balancer and attaching EC2 instances to it is a pivotal step in ensuring that your application is highly available and resilient to varying load levels. By efficiently distributing incoming traffic, ELB ensures that no single server bears too much demand, providing an optimal user experience.
