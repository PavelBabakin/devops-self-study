# Task 18: Explore ArgoCD's AutoSync feature to automatically apply changes without manual intervention.

ArgoCD's AutoSync feature is a powerful tool in the world of GitOps, allowing you to automate the deployment of changes without manual intervention. This feature enhances the efficiency of your DevOps and GitOps workflow by continuously monitoring your Git repositories and automatically applying changes when they occur. In this article, we will explore how to use ArgoCD's AutoSync feature to streamline the deployment process.

### **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **ArgoCD Installed**: Make sure ArgoCD is correctly installed on your Kubernetes cluster.
2. **Git Repository**: You should have a Git repository containing the Kubernetes manifests for your applications.
3. **ArgoCD Applications**: Your applications should already be configured and managed in ArgoCD.

### **Exploring ArgoCD's AutoSync Feature**

Follow these steps to explore ArgoCD's AutoSync feature for automated change deployment:

**Step 1: Access the ArgoCD Dashboard**

1. Open the ArgoCD dashboard in your web browser and log in.

**Step 2: Locate the AutoSync Configuration**

1. In the ArgoCD dashboard, navigate to the application that you want to enable AutoSync for.
2. Click on the application to access its details.
3. In the application details, you will find the "Sync Policy" section. Here, you can configure AutoSync.

**Step 3: Enable AutoSync**

1. In the "Sync Policy" section, enable AutoSync for the application.
2. Define the frequency at which you want ArgoCD to automatically check for changes in your Git repository. This frequency can be set to a specific time interval or on a cron schedule.

**Step 4: Configure Additional AutoSync Settings**

1. Depending on your needs, you can configure additional AutoSync settings. These settings include:
    - **Self Healing**: Enable self-healing to automatically correct any drift between the actual cluster state and the desired state defined in your Git repository.
    - **Prune Resources**: Set ArgoCD to automatically remove any resources that are no longer defined in your Git repository. This helps maintain a clean and consistent environment.
    - **Synchronization Window**: Define a specific time window during which AutoSync should be active. This is useful for scheduling deployments during periods of low traffic or maintenance windows.

**Step 5: Save and Apply Changes**

1. Save the AutoSync configuration for the application.
2. ArgoCD will now automatically check for changes in your Git repository according to the defined frequency.

**Step 6: Monitor AutoSync Activity**

1. Continuously monitor the AutoSync activity in the ArgoCD dashboard. You can view logs and synchronization status to ensure that changes are being automatically applied as expected.

**Step 7: Fine-Tune AutoSync Settings**

1. As needed, fine-tune the AutoSync settings based on the specific requirements of your applications and deployment process. Adjust the synchronization frequency, self-healing, pruning, and synchronization window to align with your operational needs.

**Step 8: Backup and Disaster Recovery**

1. Implement backup and disaster recovery strategies for your Git repository and ArgoCD configurations to ensure the safety and availability of your GitOps workflow, including AutoSync settings.

### **Conclusion**

ArgoCD's AutoSync feature automates the deployment process, making it more efficient and less reliant on manual interventions. By following these steps, you can enhance the agility and reliability of your DevOps and GitOps workflow, allowing you to respond to changes and updates in a timely manner.
