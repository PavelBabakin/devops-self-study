# Task 14: Explore CircleCI Orbs to simplify common tasks in your pipeline.

CircleCI Orbs are reusable packages of configuration that can simplify and standardize common tasks in your CI/CD pipeline. In this task, we'll explore how to use CircleCI Orbs to make your pipeline configuration more efficient and maintainable.

### **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, make sure you have set up a project in CircleCI and have a basic understanding of your project's build and test requirements.

### **Exploring CircleCI Orbs**

Follow these steps to explore and use CircleCI Orbs:

### Step 1: Access Your Project in CircleCI

1. Log in to your CircleCI account.
2. Access your project in CircleCI by clicking on it in the project list on the dashboard.

### Step 2: Navigate to "Jobs"

In the project dashboard, click on the "Jobs" tab. This is where you configure the jobs for your project's pipeline.

### Step 3: Explore Available Orbs

CircleCI provides a library of pre-built Orbs that you can use to simplify your pipeline configuration. You can search for available orbs in the "Orbs" tab, which is typically located in the left navigation panel of your project's dashboard.

### Step 4: Add Orbs to Your Configuration

You can add orbs to your project's pipeline configuration by editing your **`.circleci/config.yml`** file. Here's an example of how to add an orb to your configuration:

```yaml
version: 2.1
executors:
  node-executor:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/node:14

orbs:
  node: circleci/node@3.0.1

jobs:
  build:
    executor: node-executor
    steps:
      - checkout

      - node/install-packages

      - run:
          name: Build
          command: npm run build

      - run:
          name: Test
          command: npm test

workflows:
  version: 2
  build-deploy:
    jobs:
      - build
```

In this example, we added the **`node`** orb to simplify the process of installing Node.js dependencies. The **`node/install-packages`** step is part of the **`node`** orb and handles the installation of Node.js packages.

### Step 5: Customize Orb Configuration

You can often customize the configuration of orbs to suit your project's needs. Consult the orb's documentation to understand the available configuration options and how to use them.

### Step 6: Commit and Monitor

After adding or customizing orbs in your pipeline configuration, commit the changes to your project's repository. CircleCI will automatically use the orbs to simplify and streamline the tasks in your pipeline.

### **Conclusion**

CircleCI Orbs are a powerful way to simplify and standardize your pipeline configuration, making it more efficient and easier to maintain. By reusing pre-built orbs or creating custom orbs, you can streamline common tasks and focus on what's unique to your project's build and test requirements.
