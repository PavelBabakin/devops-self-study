# Task 3: Monitor system and application metrics using Datadog's built-in integrations.

Datadog's built-in integrations provide a seamless way to monitor a diverse range of technologies and platforms. These integrations offer pre-configured dashboards and metrics, making it easy to track the performance and health of your systems and applications.

### ***1. Infrastructure Integrations**

Datadog provides integrations for various infrastructure components, including servers, cloud providers, containers, and orchestration tools. Here's how you can use them:

- **Servers**: Datadog can monitor system-level metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and more on your servers. Simply install the Datadog agent on your servers, and these metrics will be automatically collected.
- **Cloud Providers**: Datadog supports cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. You can integrate your cloud accounts and gather metrics related to your cloud resources, such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and Azure VMs.
- **Containers and Orchestration**: If you're using container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes or Docker, Datadog offers integrations to monitor containerized applications. You can collect data on container performance, resource usage, and more.

### **2. Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**

Datadog's APM integration allows you to trace requests across your applications and microservices. You can monitor response times, errors, and dependencies, and gain insights into your application's performance. Here's how to use it:

- **Instrumentation**: To get started with APM, you'll need to instrument your application code. Datadog provides client libraries for various languages, making it easy to send trace data to Datadog.
- **Trace Visualization**: Datadog's APM provides a visual representation of request traces, allowing you to identify bottlenecks and performance issues in your application.
- **Dependency Mapping**: You can see how different services interact with each other, helping you understand the flow of requests across various microservices.

### **3. Database and Middleware Integrations**

Datadog offers integrations for popular databases and middleware. This allows you to monitor database performance, query performance, and middleware-related metrics. Here's how you can use these integrations:

- **Database Monitoring**: Datadog supports databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and more. You can track query performance, connection statistics, and other database-specific metrics.
- **Middleware Monitoring**: For middleware components like Redis, Kafka, and RabbitMQ, Datadog provides integrations to monitor message queues, broker performance, and more.

### **4. Network and IoT Integrations**

Datadog also offers integrations for network monitoring and IoT devices. You can collect data related to network traffic, device status, and more.

- **Network Monitoring**: Monitor network performance, bandwidth usage, and analyze network traffic to identify potential issues.
- **IoT Device Monitoring**: If you have IoT devices, Datadog can help you track device status, connectivity, and other IoT-related metrics.

### **Conclusion**

Datadog's built-in integrations make it easy to monitor a wide range of systems and applications. By leveraging these integrations, you can gain insights into system health, application performance, and more. Datadog provides pre-configured dashboards, alerts, and visualization tools to help you make data-driven decisions and ensure the reliability of your software.

In the next tasks, we'll explore more Datadog features, such as creating custom dashboards, setting up alerts, and using APM for in-depth application performance analysis. Stay tuned for more insights into application monitoring.

Remember that Datadog's integrations are continually updated, so you can keep up with the latest technologies and trends in your monitoring efforts.
