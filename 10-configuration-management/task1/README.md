**Step 2: Installing Ansible**

### **Method 1: Installing via Package Manager**

### For Ubuntu/Debian:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible
```

### For CentOS/RHEL:

```
sudo yum install ansible
```

### For macOS:

```
brew install ansible
```

### **Method 2: Installing via Python’s Package Manager (pip)**

```
pip install ansible
```

### **Method 3: Installing from Source**

For the latest version or to contribute to Ansible’s development:

```
git clone https://github.com/ansible/ansible.git
cd ansible
source hacking/env-setup
```

**Step 4: Basic Configuration**

### **Ansible Configuration File:**

- Located at **`/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`** (global settings).
- Can be created in your project directory for local settings.

### **Inventory File:**

- Default location: **`/etc/ansible/hosts`**.
- Specifies the hosts you’ll manage with Ansible.

### **Example Inventory File:**

```
[webservers]
webserver1.example.com
webserver2.example.com

[dbservers]
dbserver1.example.com
```

**Step 5: Running Your First Ansible Command**

Test connectivity to your nodes using a basic Ansible command:

```
ansible all -m ping
```

Ensure all nodes are reachable and responding to manage them using Ansible.
