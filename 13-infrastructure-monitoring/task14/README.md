# Task 14: Monitor system and application metrics using Datadog's built-in integrations.

In Task 13, we got acquainted with Datadog's main components and dashboard. In Task 14, we will take a practical approach to monitoring by exploring Datadog's built-in integrations. Datadog simplifies monitoring by offering a vast library of pre-configured integrations that allow you to collect and visualize system and application metrics seamlessly.

### **Prerequisites:**

Before we begin, ensure you have:

1. A Datadog account and the Datadog agent installed on your server or local machine (as discussed in Task 12).
2. A basic understanding of the system and application metrics you want to monitor.

### **Monitoring System and Application Metrics with Datadog's Built-in Integrations:**

Let's explore how to leverage Datadog's built-in integrations to monitor system and application metrics:

1. **Access the Datadog Dashboard:**
    
    Log in to your Datadog account and access the Datadog dashboard. This is where you'll configure and monitor your integrations.
    
2. **Browse the Integrations Library:**
    
    From the Datadog dashboard, go to the "Integrations" menu. Here, you will find the "Integrations" page.
    
3. **Explore Available Integrations:**
    
    The "Integrations" page lists numerous pre-configured integrations for various technologies, services, and platforms. You can use the search bar to find integrations for specific services, or you can browse the available categories.
    
4. **Select an Integration:**
    
    Choose an integration that corresponds to the system or application you want to monitor. For example, if you want to monitor an NGINX web server, select the "NGINX" integration.
    
5. **Enable the Integration:**
    
    After selecting an integration, you'll be presented with configuration options. These options may include settings such as API keys, authentication credentials, and monitoring targets.
    
    - Fill in the required information to configure the integration.
    - Once the integration is configured, enable it.
6. **Review the Integration Dashboard:**
    
    Datadog automatically generates a dashboard for the selected integration. This dashboard provides a visual representation of metrics related to the integrated service. You can access this dashboard by navigating to the "Dashboards" menu and selecting the integration-specific dashboard.
    
7. **Customize the Dashboard:**
    
    The integration dashboard is fully customizable. You can adjust the layout, add or remove panels, and fine-tune visualizations to suit your specific monitoring needs. For example, you can add custom alerts to monitor critical thresholds.
    
8. **View and Analyze Metrics:**
    
    Use the integration dashboard to monitor and analyze system and application metrics in real-time. You can explore data related to performance, resource utilization, error rates, and more.
    
9. **Set Up Alerts:**
    
    Datadog allows you to set up alerts based on the metrics collected from your integrations. Configure alerting rules to be notified when metrics breach specified thresholds. This is crucial for proactively addressing issues.
    
10. **Monitoring Multiple Integrations:**
    
    Repeat the same process for other integrations you want to monitor. Datadog allows you to monitor a wide range of systems and applications, ensuring comprehensive visibility into your infrastructure.
    
11. **Advanced Configuration:**
    
    Datadog's integrations provide advanced configuration options, including the ability to add tags, create custom queries, and customize alert conditions. Explore these options to tailor your monitoring setup.
    

Conclusion:

Leveraging Datadog's built-in integrations is a powerful way to monitor system and application metrics efficiently. In this article, we explored the process of selecting, configuring, and monitoring integrations in Datadog. With Datadog's extensive library of integrations, you can effortlessly monitor a diverse set of technologies and services, gaining insights into the performance and reliability of your infrastructure.

In the upcoming tasks, we will continue to explore Datadog's features, diving deeper into advanced monitoring techniques, visualization, and proactive alerting.
