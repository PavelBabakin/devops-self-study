# Task 18: Invoke the function using the provided endpoint and view the logs in Stackdriver.

After deploying a Cloud Function on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the subsequent steps involve invoking the function and monitoring its execution. GCP provides a straightforward way to invoke functions via HTTP endpoints and offers Stackdriver Logging to monitor and troubleshoot your functions. In this guide, we will explore how to invoke a Cloud Function using the provided endpoint and utilize Stackdriver Logging to view the logs generated during function execution.

**Step 1: Invoking the Cloud Function**

1. **Retrieve Function URL:**
    - Navigate to the Cloud Functions section in the GCP Console.
    - Select your function and copy the URL provided in the “Trigger” section.
2. **HTTP Request:**
    - Use tools like **`curl`**, Postman, or your browser to send an HTTP request to the function URL and observe the response.
    
    Example using **`curl`**:
    
    ```bash
    curl [Your-Function-URL]
    ```
    
3. **Validate Response:**
    - Ensure that the function returns the expected HTTP status code and response body.

**Step 2: Accessing Stackdriver Logging**

1. **Navigate to Logs Explorer:**
    - In the GCP Console, navigate to “Operations” and select “Logs Explorer.”
2. **Selecting the GCP Project:**
    - Ensure that your GCP project is selected in the “Project” dropdown.
3. **Viewing Cloud Function Logs:**
    - In the “Resource” dropdown, select “Cloud Function.”
    - Specify the function name in the “Log name” dropdown to filter logs.

**Step 3: Analyzing Logs in Stackdriver**

1. **Log Entries:**
    - Observe the log entries generated during function execution, which include information like timestamp, severity, and log message.
2. **Log Details:**
    - Click on a log entry to view detailed information, such as execution time, status, and payload.
3. **Filtering Logs:**
    - Utilize filtering options to narrow down logs based on criteria like severity, timestamp, and text search.

**Step 4: Troubleshooting with Logs**

1. **Identifying Issues:**
    - Analyze logs to identify any issues or errors during function execution.
2. **Correlating Logs:**
    - Correlate logs with function invocations to troubleshoot issues and understand the function’s behavior.
3. **Optimizing Function:**
    - Use logs to identify optimization opportunities, such as reducing execution time and managing resources efficiently.

**Step 5: Setting Up Log-Based Metrics and Alerts**

1. **Creating Log-Based Metrics:**
    - Utilize Stackdriver to create log-based metrics, enabling you to monitor specific log entries.
2. **Setting Up Alerts:**
    - Configure alerting policies in Stackdriver Monitoring to receive notifications based on log-based metrics and conditions.
