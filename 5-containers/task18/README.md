# Task 18: Clone an existing LXC container and start it.

In the realm of LXC (Linux Containers), cloning represents a swift method to duplicate existing containers, preserving their state and configuration. This can be particularly useful for testing, scaling, and backup purposes. In this article, we will guide you through the process of cloning an existing LXC container and starting the clone.

---

### Prerequisites

- LXC installed and configured on your machine.
- An existing LXC container to clone.

---

### Step 1: Identifying the Source Container

Ensure the container you wish to clone is present and identify its name using the **`lxc-list`** command.

```
lxc-list
```

---

### Step 2: Cloning the LXC Container

### **Syntax**

```
lxc-copy -n [source_container] -N [clone_name]
```

### **Example**

Assuming we have a container named **`my_ubuntu_container`** that we wish to clone into a new container named **`my_cloned_container`**.

```
lxc-copy -n my_ubuntu_container -N my_cloned_container
```

### **Key Points**

- **`n [source_container]`**: Specifies the name of the container to be cloned.
- **`N [clone_name]`**: Defines the name of the new cloned container.

---

### Step 3: Verifying the Clone

Ensure that the cloned container is available using the **`lxc-list`** command.

```
lxc-list
```

You should see **`my_cloned_container`** listed among the available containers.

---

### Step 4: Starting the Cloned Container

### **Syntax**

```
lxc-start -n [clone_name]
```

### **Example**

```
lxc-start -n my_cloned_container
```

---

### Step 5: Accessing the Cloned Container

### **Syntax**

```
lxc-attach -n [clone_name]
```

### **Example**

```
lxc-attach -n my_cloned_container
```

---

### Conclusion

Cloning LXC containers is a straightforward yet powerful feature that allows you to duplicate containers effortlessly, ensuring configurations, installed software, and states are preserved. This can be pivotal for testing environments, creating backups, or scaling applications horizontally by deploying identical containers.
