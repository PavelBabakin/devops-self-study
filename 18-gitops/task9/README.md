# Task 9: Explore the ArgoCD rollback feature to revert to a previous application state.

In the GitOps workflow, the ability to quickly and safely revert to a previous application state is a valuable feature. ArgoCD provides a rollback feature that enables you to roll back to a known-good state of your application, ensuring high availability and reliability. In this article, we will guide you through exploring and using the ArgoCD rollback feature.

### **Prerequisites**

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **ArgoCD Installed**: Make sure ArgoCD is correctly installed on your Kubernetes cluster.
2. **Git Repository**: You should have a Git repository containing the Kubernetes manifests for your application.
3. **Changes Made**: You should have previously made changes to your application's manifests in the Git repository, as described in the previous article.

### **Exploring the ArgoCD Rollback Feature**

Follow these steps to explore and use the ArgoCD rollback feature:

**Step 1: Access the ArgoCD Dashboard**

1. Open a web browser and navigate to the URL where you exposed the ArgoCD web UI. By default, it should be **`http://localhost:8080`** if you followed the installation steps.
2. Log in to the ArgoCD dashboard with your credentials.

**Step 2: View Application Details**

1. In the ArgoCD dashboard, click on the "Applications" tab.
2. Click on the name of the application for which you want to perform a rollback. This will take you to the application details page.

**Step 3: View Synchronization History**

1. On the application details page, click on the "History" tab. This tab displays the synchronization history of your application.
2. You will see a list of synchronization events, including the dates, commits, and sync statuses.

**Step 4: Select a Previous Synchronization**

1. From the list of synchronization events, choose a previous synchronization that represents a known-good state you want to roll back to. This could be a synchronization event before you introduced problematic changes.

**Step 5: Initiate Rollback**

1. To initiate the rollback, click the "Rollback" button next to the selected synchronization event.
2. ArgoCD will prompt you to confirm the rollback. Review the information and click "Confirm" to proceed.

**Step 6: Monitor Rollback Progress**

1. ArgoCD will initiate the rollback process. You can monitor the rollback progress by checking the synchronization status on the application details page.
2. ArgoCD will automatically synchronize the application to the state recorded in the selected synchronization event, effectively rolling back to that state.

**Step 7: Verification**

1. After the rollback is complete, use **`kubectl`** to verify that your application has been rolled back to the previous state. Check the status of the application's resources, pods, or services as needed.
2. Access your application to ensure it is running as expected in the previous known-good state.

### **Conclusion**

The ArgoCD rollback feature is a powerful tool for ensuring the reliability and high availability of your applications in a GitOps workflow. It allows you to quickly and safely revert to a previous known-good state when issues or problems arise.

In the upcoming articles, we will delve into advanced deployment strategies and configurations with ArgoCD, helping you master GitOps practices. Stay tuned for more insights into the world of DevOps and GitOps.
