**Step 3: Navigating to Azure Functions**

1. **Accessing Azure Functions:**
    - In the Azure Portal, click on “Create a resource” and select “Function App” under the “Compute” category. Alternatively, use the search bar to find and navigate to Azure Functions.
2. **Understanding the Azure Functions Dashboard:**
    - **Function Apps:** View and manage your function apps.
    - **Functions:** Manage individual functions within a function app.
    - **Proxies:** Define endpoints on your function app that are implemented by another resource.
    - **Slots:** Manage deployment slots, which allow you to host different versions of your function app.

**Step 4: Grasping Azure Functions Concepts**

1. **Functions and Triggers:**
    - Functions contain your executable code while triggers define how a function is invoked.
2. **Bindings:**
    - Bindings are optional connections to other resources, like databases and storage, which your function interacts with.
3. **Scaling and Hosting:**
    - Azure Functions can scale automatically based on demand and can be hosted on various plans like Consumption Plan, Premium Plan, and Dedicated (App Service) Plan.

**Step 5: Exploring Azure Functions Free Tier**

1. **Free Tier Usage:**
    - Azure Functions’ Free Tier includes 1 million free requests per month and 400,000 GB-s of resource consumption per month.
2. **Monitoring Usage:**
    - Utilize Azure Monitor to keep track of your usage and ensure that you stay within the Free Tier limits to avoid additional charges.
