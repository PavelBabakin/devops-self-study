# Task 8: Retrieve the deployed artifact using the Artifactory UI and API.

In Task 8 of your DevOps journey, we'll explore how to retrieve artifacts that you've previously deployed to a local repository in JFrog Artifactory. Retrieving artifacts is as crucial as deploying them, as it ensures that you can access and use the desired versions of your dependencies. We will cover two methods: using the Artifactory UI and the Artifactory API.

**Prerequisites**

Before we proceed, ensure that you have:

1. Successfully deployed an artifact to a local repository in Artifactory, as explained in Task 7.
2. Access to the Artifactory dashboard.

**Method 1: Using the Artifactory UI**

1. **Access the Artifactory Dashboard**: Log in to the Artifactory dashboard using your web browser.
2. **Navigate to the Repository**: Click on the "Repositories" tab in the left sidebar to access the list of repositories.
3. **Select Your Local Repository**: Choose the local repository where you've previously deployed your artifact. Click on the repository's name to open it.
4. **Browse the Artifact Tree**: In the local repository, you will typically find an "Artifact Tree" option. This is a graphical representation of the repository's contents, including the deployed artifacts.
5. **Locate Your Artifact**: Navigate through the folders and subfolders to find your deployed JAR file. You can click on the file to view its details.
6. **Download the Artifact**: In the artifact's details view, you'll find a download option. Click the download button to retrieve the artifact to your local machine.

**Method 2: Using the Artifactory API**

1. **Construct the API URL**: To retrieve an artifact using the Artifactory API, you need to construct the appropriate URL. The URL format is typically: **`http://<artifactory-server>:<port>/artifactory/<repository>/<path-to-artifact>`**.
    
    Replace **`<artifactory-server>`**, **`<port>`**, **`<repository>`**, and **`<path-to-artifact>`** with your specific values.
    
2. **Make a GET Request**: Using your preferred method or tool for making HTTP requests (e.g., cURL, Postman, or a programming language), make a GET request to the constructed URL.
    
    Example using cURL:
    
    ```bash
    curl -O http://<artifactory-server>:<port>/artifactory/<repository>/<path-to-artifact>
    ```
    
    This command downloads the artifact to your local machine.
    

**Use Cases for Retrieving Artifacts**

- **Building and Compiling**: Retrieving artifacts is essential for building and compiling your software projects, ensuring that you use the correct versions of dependencies.
- **Continuous Integration**: In CI/CD pipelines, retrieving artifacts is crucial to fetch the necessary components for your automated builds.
- **Debugging and Troubleshooting**: When debugging or troubleshooting issues, you may need to access specific versions of artifacts to recreate and analyze problems.
- **Efficient Collaboration**: Retrieving artifacts from a central repository streamlines collaboration within your team, as everyone can access the same set of dependencies.

Conclusion

Retrieving artifacts from JFrog Artifactory is an essential aspect of effective artifact management in the DevOps process. Whether you use the Artifactory UI or the Artifactory API, having the ability to access the exact versions of your dependencies is pivotal for maintaining version control, stability, and reproducibility in your software development and deployment projects. In the upcoming tasks, we'll explore more DevOps actions, including integrating Artifactory with popular build tools, setting up security measures, and leveraging advanced features. Stay tuned for additional hands-on exercises and insights on your journey to becoming a proficient DevOps engineer.
