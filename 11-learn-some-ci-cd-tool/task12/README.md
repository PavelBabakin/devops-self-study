# Task 12: Sign up for CircleCI using your version control account.

CircleCI is a popular continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipelines. In this task, we'll sign up for CircleCI using your version control account and set up a project.

### **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, make sure you have a version control account with a project that you want to set up in CircleCI. This project should have a configuration file (typically, **`.circleci/config.yml`**) to define your build and test pipeline.

### **Signing Up for CircleCI**

Follow these steps to sign up for CircleCI:

### Step 1: Visit the CircleCI Website

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the CircleCI website ([https://circleci.com/](https://circleci.com/)).

### Step 2: Sign Up

1. Click on the "Sign Up" button on the top right corner of the website.

### Step 3: Choose Your Version Control Service

1. You'll be prompted to choose your version control service. CircleCI supports GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, Bitbucket, and GitLab. Select the one you're using.
2. Follow the prompts to authorize CircleCI to access your version control account.

### Step 4: Authorize CircleCI

1. You'll be redirected to your version control provider's site (e.g., GitHub) to authorize the integration.
2. Follow the instructions on your version control provider's site to grant CircleCI access.

### Step 5: Create an Account

1. After authorizing the integration, you'll be asked to create a CircleCI account. Fill in the necessary details to complete the account creation.
2. Verify your email address by clicking on the link sent to your email.

### Step 6: Start Building

1. Once your account is set up, you'll be taken to the CircleCI dashboard.
2. To set up a project, click the "Add Projects" button.

### Step 7: Set Up Your Project

1. Select your project from the list of repositories associated with your version control account.
2. Follow the instructions to set up your project and define your build and test pipeline. You'll typically create or upload a **`.circleci/config.yml`** file in your repository to define the pipeline.
3. CircleCI will automatically start building and testing your project according to the configuration.

### **Conclusion**

Signing up for CircleCI and setting up a project is the first step in automating your CI/CD pipeline. Once your project is set up, CircleCI will automatically build, test, and deploy your code as defined in the configuration file. This helps ensure the reliability and quality of your software development process.
