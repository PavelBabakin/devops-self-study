# Task 5: Retrieve the stored secret using the Vault CLI and API.

Welcome back to our journey of mastering HashiCorp Vault. In this article, we'll explore Task 5: Retrieving the stored secret using the Vault CLI and API. This is where we put our secrets to use securely!

## **Retrieving Secrets from Vault**

Once you've stored secrets in HashiCorp Vault using the Key/Value secrets engine, it's crucial to know how to retrieve them. Vault provides various methods to access your secrets, including the Vault CLI and the Vault API.

### **Using the Vault CLI**

To retrieve a stored secret using the Vault CLI, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Open Your Terminal**

Open your terminal and ensure you have authenticated with Vault using a token with sufficient permissions.

**Step 2: Retrieve the Secret**

To retrieve the secret we stored earlier, use the following command:

```
vault kv get secret/myapp/credentials
```

Vault will respond with the key-value pairs we stored earlier, which, in this case, is the username and password.

### **Using the Vault API**

Retrieving secrets programmatically can be done using the Vault API. This is particularly useful for automation and integration with other systems. Here's a simplified example of how to retrieve a secret using the Vault API in Python:

```python
import requests

url = "http://your-vault-server:8200/v1/secret/data/myapp/credentials"
headers = {
    "X-Vault-Token": "your_token",
}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
data = response.json()
secrets = data["data"]["data"]
print("Secrets:", secrets)
```

Replace **`"your-vault-server"`** with the address of your Vault server, and **`"your_token"`** with a valid token with the necessary permissions.

## **Best Practices**

When retrieving secrets from Vault, keep these best practices in mind:

1. **Access Control**: Ensure that the tokens used to retrieve secrets have appropriate access control policies applied to them.
2. **Transport Security**: Always use HTTPS when interacting with the Vault API to encrypt data in transit.
3. **Audit Logging**: Enable Vault's audit logging to track access to secrets for security and compliance purposes.
4. **Token Management**: Be vigilant in managing tokens. Revoke tokens when they are no longer needed, and avoid hardcoding tokens in scripts.

## **Conclusion**

Retrieving stored secrets in HashiCorp Vault is a fundamental step in the secret management process. Whether you're using the Vault CLI for manual operations or the Vault API for automation, it's crucial to have a secure and controlled method to access your sensitive data.

In the next article, we'll explore more advanced features of Vault, including dynamic secrets, which allow you to generate and manage credentials dynamically for enhanced security.
