# Task 23: Troubleshoot common issues: service failures, disk space issues, and network connectivity problems.

Every system administrator or DevOps engineer will, at some point, face the challenges of troubleshooting. Whether it's a service that refuses to start, dwindling disk space, or a pesky network issue, the ability to diagnose and rectify problems is crucial. In this guide, we'll delve into common system issues and their solutions.

**1. Service Failures**:

- **Symptoms**: Applications not responding, error messages, services not starting.
- **Troubleshooting Steps**:
    1. **Check Service Status**: Use commands like **`systemctl status <service_name>`** or **`service <service_name> status`** to check the service's status.
    2. **Review Logs**: Logs often provide insights into what went wrong. Check service-specific logs or system logs like **`/var/log/syslog`**.
    3. **Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies required by the service are installed and running.
    4. **Configuration Files**: A misconfigured file can prevent a service from starting. Validate configuration files for syntax errors.

**2. Disk Space Issues**:

- **Symptoms**: System slowdowns, applications crashing, error messages about insufficient storage.
- **Troubleshooting Steps**:
    1. **Check Disk Usage**: Use **`df -h`** to see disk partitions and their usage.
    2. **Find Large Files**: Commands like **`du -sh *`** or tools like **`ncdu`** can help identify large files or directories.
    3. **Log Files**: Over time, log files can consume significant space. Consider log rotation or cleanup.
    4. **Temporary Files**: Clear out the **`/tmp`** directory and other cache locations.

**3. Network Connectivity Problems**:

- **Symptoms**: Inability to access websites, services not reachable, slow network speeds.
- **Troubleshooting Steps**:
    1. **Ping Test**: Use **`ping`** to check connectivity to local and external IP addresses.
    2. **Check Network Services**: Ensure services like **`NetworkManager`** or **`networking`** are running.
    3. **Review Network Configuration**: Check IP, gateway, and DNS settings for correctness.
    4. **Firewall Rules**: Ensure firewall rules aren't blocking necessary traffic. Tools like **`ufw`**, **`firewalld`**, or **`iptables`** can be used to manage rules.
    5. **Hardware Issues**: Check cables, routers, and switches for any physical issues.

**Conclusion**:
Troubleshooting is as much an art as it is a science. While tools and commands provide the means to diagnose issues, experience and intuition often guide the troubleshooting process. By understanding common problems and their solutions, system administrators can ensure quick resolutions, minimizing downtime and ensuring smooth operations.
