# Task 12: Monitor your infrastructure's health and performance, including CPU, memory, and disk usage.

Monitoring the health and performance of your infrastructure is essential to ensure the reliability and stability of your applications. New Relic offers powerful tools to track metrics like CPU usage, memory, and disk usage, enabling you to identify and address potential issues promptly.

### 1. Accessing Infrastructure Monitoring

To start monitoring your infrastructure in New Relic, follow these initial steps:

- Log in to your New Relic account and access the New Relic One dashboard.
- Navigate to the "Infrastructure" section, which provides insights into the health and performance of your servers and systems.

### 2. Key Infrastructure Metrics

In the Infrastructure section, you can access essential infrastructure metrics, including:

- **CPU Usage**: Monitor the percentage of CPU resources utilized by your servers. High CPU usage can indicate a lack of processing power or inefficient processes.
- **Memory Usage**: Keep an eye on memory consumption to ensure that your servers have sufficient RAM available. High memory usage can lead to performance degradation or out-of-memory errors.
- **Disk Usage**: Track the usage of your server's storage space. Running out of disk space can result in application crashes and data loss.
- **Network Throughput**: Monitor network traffic to assess data transfer rates and identify potential network bottlenecks.
- **Load Average**: Check the server's load average, which indicates the number of processes waiting for CPU time. High load averages can lead to slow response times.

### 3. Visualizing Metrics

New Relic provides intuitive ways to visualize infrastructure metrics, allowing you to easily grasp performance trends and anomalies:

- Explore interactive charts and graphs to view historical data for CPU, memory, and disk usage.
- Customize the time range to focus on specific periods, such as the last hour, day, or week.
- Create custom dashboards to combine infrastructure metrics with application performance data for a holistic view of your software stack.

### 4. Setting Up Alerts

To proactively manage your infrastructure's health, it's essential to configure alerting for critical metrics:

- Define alert conditions based on CPU, memory, and disk usage thresholds that are appropriate for your infrastructure.
- Set up alert policies to specify how and when alerts should be triggered, and designate notification channels to inform the right team members.
- Regularly review alert policies to ensure they remain relevant as your infrastructure scales or evolves.

### 5. Analyzing Trends

In addition to real-time monitoring, New Relic allows you to analyze performance trends and historical data:

- Review historical metrics to identify long-term patterns and make informed decisions about infrastructure capacity and optimization.
- Compare current metrics with historical data to detect unusual spikes or dips in resource usage.
- Utilize machine learning and anomaly detection features to identify subtle deviations in performance metrics that may require attention.

### **Conclusion**

Monitoring your infrastructure's health and performance in New Relic is essential for maintaining the reliability and stability of your applications. By tracking metrics like CPU usage, memory, and disk usage, you can proactively address issues, allocate resources efficiently, and ensure a seamless user experience.

In the upcoming tasks, we'll continue to explore New Relic's capabilities, such as setting up alerts for infrastructure metrics, optimizing your infrastructure for performance, and analyzing user experience data. New Relic offers a comprehensive suite of tools to help you monitor and enhance the performance and health of your applications and infrastructure.

Consistent monitoring and proactive management are key to delivering high-quality software and maintaining a positive user experience.
