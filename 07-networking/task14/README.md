# Task 14: Configure a domain to point to your web server using A or CNAME records.

Ensuring that your domain points to your web server is pivotal for making your website accessible via the web. DNS records, particularly A (Address Record) and CNAME (Canonical Name), play a crucial role in mapping domain names to the respective IP addresses of web servers. In this guide, we will explore how to configure a domain to point to your web server using A and CNAME records.

**Prerequisites**

- A domain name registered through a domain registrar
- A web server with a static IP address
- Access to DNS management (usually through your domain registrar or DNS hosting provider)
- Basic understanding of DNS records

**Step 1: Understanding A and CNAME Records**

- **A Record**: Maps a domain or subdomain directly to an IP address.
- **CNAME Record**: Alias a domain or subdomain to another domain name.

**Step 2: Configuring an A Record**

1. **Access DNS Management**: Log in to your domain registrar or DNS hosting provider and navigate to DNS management for your domain.
2. **Add/Edit A Record**:
    - **Type**: Select "A".
    - **Host**: Specify the subdomain (use "@" for the root domain).
    - **Value**: Enter the IP address of your web server.
    - **TTL**: Time-to-live (you may leave it as default or set as per requirement).
3. **Save Changes**: Apply and save the DNS settings.

**Step 3: Configuring a CNAME Record**

1. **Access DNS Management**: Navigate to the DNS settings of your domain.
2. **Add/Edit CNAME Record**:
    - **Type**: Select "CNAME".
    - **Host**: Specify the subdomain (e.g., "www").
    - **Value**: Enter the domain to which it should alias (e.g., "example.com").
    - **TTL**: Set as per requirement.
3. **Save Changes**: Ensure to save the DNS settings.

**Step 4: Verifying the DNS Configuration**

- **Check Propagation**: Use online tools like [DNS Checker](https://dnschecker.org/) to verify the DNS propagation worldwide.
- **Use Command-Line Tools**: Utilize **`ping`**, **`dig`**, or **`nslookup`** to verify the DNS resolution.Ensure it returns the correct IP address of your web server.
    
    ```bash
    dig +short example.com
    ```
    

**Step 5: Validating Web Server Accessibility**

- **Browser Check**: Enter your domain in a web browser and ensure it loads your website.
- **SSL/TLS Check**: If your website uses HTTPS, ensure the SSL/TLS certificate matches the domain.

**Conclusion**

Successfully configuring A and CNAME records to point your domain to your web server ensures that users can access your website using your domain name. This foundational DNS management skill is pivotal for web administrators and developers in deploying accessible and user-friendly websites.
