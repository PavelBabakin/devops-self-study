# Task 26: Set up a CI/CD pipeline using Google Cloud Build.

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) are crucial practices in modern software development, enabling teams to automate the testing and deployment of applications. Google Cloud Build offers a platform that allows developers to build fast, consistent, and reliable automated pipelines. In this guide, we will explore how to set up a CI/CD pipeline using Google Cloud Build, providing a hands-on approach to automating workflows in Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

**Step 1: Navigating to Cloud Build**

- **Access GCP Console**: Log into the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
- **Navigate to Cloud Build**: From the navigation menu on the left, click on “Cloud Build”.

**Step 2: Configuring a Build Trigger**

- **Create Trigger**: Click on “Triggers” in the left-hand menu, then click on “Create Trigger”.
- **Source Repository**: Connect to your source code repository (like Cloud Source Repositories, GitHub, or Bitbucket).
- **Configuration**: Define the name, event (e.g., push to a branch), and source (e.g., branch name).
- **Build Configuration**: Specify how Cloud Build will construct your build, using either **`cloudbuild.yaml`** or Dockerfile.
- **Create**: Click on “Create” to set up the trigger.

**Step 3: Defining the Build Configuration**

- **Create `cloudbuild.yaml`**: Define the build steps, substitutions, and options in a **`cloudbuild.yaml`** file in your repository.
    
    ```yaml
    steps:
    - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
      args: ['build', '-t', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/my-image', '.']
    images:
    - 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/my-image'
    ```
    
- **Push to Repository**: Push the **`cloudbuild.yaml`** file to your source repository to initiate the CI/CD pipeline.

**Step 4: Monitoring the Build**

- **View Builds**: Navigate to “History” in the Cloud Build menu to view the status, logs, and details of the builds.
- **Logs**: Click on a build to view its detailed logs, artifacts, and source information.

**Step 5: Deploying the Build**

- **Automate Deployment**: Optionally, add deployment steps in the **`cloudbuild.yaml`** to automate the deployment of the build to environments like GKE, App Engine, or Firebase.
- **Manual Deployment**: Alternatively, use the built images or artifacts for manual deployment to your desired environment.

**Conclusion**

Setting up a CI/CD pipeline using Google Cloud Build provides a streamlined and automated approach to managing the build and deployment processes in software development. From configuring build triggers to deploying builds, Cloud Build offers a robust and scalable platform for handling various CI/CD needs. As we continue to explore GCP, our subsequent guides will delve into more advanced CI/CD practices and use-cases with Cloud Build. Stay tuned for more hands-on tasks and insights!
