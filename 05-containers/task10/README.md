# Task 10: Explore Docker's networking features by connecting multiple containers.

Docker networking allows containers to communicate with each other and with external systems. In a multi-container application, understanding and managing Docker networking is crucial to ensure seamless interaction between different services (containers). In this article, we will explore Docker's networking features and understand how to connect multiple containers.

### Docker Networking: A Brief Overview

Docker provides a robust networking model that allows containers to communicate within a single host and between different hosts. Some key components of Docker networking include:

- **Network Drivers**: Docker supports different network drivers (bridge, overlay, macvlan, etc.) each suitable for specific use cases.
- **Network**: A path that facilitates communication between containers.
- **Network Modes**: Docker containers can run in different network modes (bridge, host, none, and container) which define how containers interact with network services.

### Connecting Multiple Containers: A Practical Guide

### **Step 1: Define a Custom Network**

Create a custom network that will be used by the containers to communicate.

```
docker network create --driver bridge my_custom_network
```

### **Step 2: Run Containers in the Defined Network**

Run your containers using the custom network defined.

```
docker run -d --name container1 --network my_custom_network my_image
docker run -d --name container2 --network my_custom_network my_image
```

### **Step 3: Container Communication**

Containers within the same network can communicate using container names as hostnames.

For instance, if **`container1`** wants to ping **`container2`**, it can do so by:

```
docker exec -it container1 ping container2
```

### **Step 4: Exposing and Mapping Ports**

To allow external communication to a container, map the containerâ€™s port to a port on the host.

```
docker run -d --name container3 -p 8080:80 --network my_custom_network my_image
```

External systems can communicate with **`container3`** using **`HOST_IP:8080`**.

### Docker Compose: Defining Networks

In a **`docker-compose.yml`**, you can define networks and associate services with them.

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  web:
    image: my_web_image
    networks:
      - my_network

  db:
    image: my_db_image
    networks:
      - my_network

networks:
  my_network:
    driver: bridge
```

Services defined under the same network can communicate using the service name as the hostname.

### Conclusion

Understanding Docker networking is pivotal in managing multi-container applications, ensuring they interact cohesively and communicate with external systems when necessary. By defining custom networks and managing port mappings, Docker provides a flexible and powerful networking model suitable for various use cases.
