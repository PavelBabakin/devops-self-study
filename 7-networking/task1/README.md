# Task 1: Set up an FTP server using software like vsftpd on a Linux machine.

File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used to transfer files from one host to another over a TCP-based network, such as the Internet or an intranet. In the realm of DevOps, understanding how to set up and manage an FTP server is crucial for facilitating the smooth transfer of files between systems. In this guide, we will walk through the steps to set up an FTP server using **`vsftpd`**, a widely-used FTP server for Linux.

**Prerequisites**

- A Linux machine (physical or virtual)
- Root or sudo access to the machine
- Basic understanding of Linux terminal commands

**Step 1: Installing vsftpd**

1. **Update Your System**: Ensure your system package repositories are up to date.
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```
    
2. **Install vsftpd**: Use the package manager to install **`vsftpd`**.
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install vsftpd
    ```
    
3. **Start and Enable vsftpd**: Ensure **`vsftpd`** starts at boot and is running.
    
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start vsftpd
    sudo systemctl enable vsftpd
    ```
    

**Step 2: Configuring vsftpd**

1. **Backup Original Configuration**: Always backup original configuration files.
    
    ```bash
    sudo cp /etc/vsftpd.conf /etc/vsftpd.conf.orig
    ```
    
2. **Edit Configuration**: Use a text editor to modify the **`vsftpd`** configuration file.
    
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf
    ```
    
    - Set the anonymous_enable directive to NO to disable anonymous login:
        
        ```
        anonymous_enable=NO
        ```
        
    - Enable local users to login by ensuring local_enable is set to YES:
        
        ```
        local_enable=YES
        ```
        
    - Allow users to upload files by setting write_enable to YES:
        
        ```
        write_enable=YES
        ```
        
    - Save and exit the text editor.
3. **Restart vsftpd**: Apply the changes by restarting **`vsftpd`**.
    
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
    ```
    

**Step 3: Creating an FTP User**

1. **Add a New User**: Create a new user specifically for FTP access.
    
    ```bash
    sudo adduser ftpuser
    ```
    
    Follow the prompts to set a password and provide user information.
    
2. **Assign Proper Permissions**: Ensure the FTP user has the necessary permissions to the FTP directory.
    
    ```bash
    sudo chown ftpuser:ftpuser /path/to/ftp/directory
    ```
    

**Step 4: Testing the FTP Server**

1. **Access via Command Line**: Use the **`ftp`** command to access the server.
    
    ```bash
    ftp [your-server-ip]
    ```
    
    Login with the **`ftpuser`** credentials and test file uploading and downloading.
    
2. **Access via FTP Client**: Alternatively, use an FTP client like FileZilla. Input the server IP, **`ftpuser`** credentials, and connect to verify functionality.

**Conclusion**

Congratulations! You have successfully set up an FTP server using **`vsftpd`** on a Linux machine. Understanding the intricacies of FTP server management is pivotal in ensuring secure and efficient file transfers, a skill indispensable in the DevOps toolkit.
