# Task 12: Create a new Pulumi project and deploy a basic resource, such as an Azure Storage Account.

Pulumi, a robust Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, enables developers to utilize familiar programming languages to define and manage cloud resources. In this tutorial, we will create a new Pulumi project and deploy a basic Azure Storage Account, providing a hands-on guide to deploying your first cloud resource with Pulumi.

---

**Step 1: Prerequisites**

- Pulumi installed and configured (refer to the previous article).
- Azure CLI installed and configured with your Azure account.
- Chosen programming language SDK installed (e.g., Node.js for TypeScript).

---

**Step 2: Setting Up a New Pulumi Project**

1. **Create a Directory:**
    - Make a new directory for your project and navigate into it.
2. **Initialize Pulumi Project:**
    - Run the following command, replacing **`[language-runtime]`** with your chosen language (e.g., **`typescript`**, **`python`**):
        
        ```bash
        pulumi new azure-[language-runtime]
        ```
        
    - Follow the prompts to configure your project.

---

**Step 3: Configuring Azure Credentials**

Ensure that Pulumi can authenticate with Azure by logging in via the Azure CLI:

```bash
az login
```

Follow the prompts to authenticate through the web interface.

---

**Step 4: Defining an Azure Storage Account with Pulumi**

Navigate to the main file of your project (e.g., **`index.ts`** for TypeScript) and define the Azure Storage Account:

```tsx
import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";

const storageAccount = new azure.storage.Account("mystorageaccount", {
    resourceGroupName: azure.core.getResourceGroup().name,
    accountTier: "Standard",
    accountReplicationType: "LRS",
});

// Export the connection string for the storage account
export const connectionString = storageAccount.primaryConnectionString;
```

Ensure to install the necessary Pulumi Azure package for your language. For TypeScript/JavaScript, you can use npm:

```bash
npm install @pulumi/azure
```

---

**Step 5: Deploying the Azure Storage Account**

1. **Preview Changes:**
    - Run **`pulumi up`** to preview the changes.
    - Review the resources that will be created.
2. **Deploy Resources:**
    - Select **`yes`** to deploy the Azure Storage Account.
    - Pulumi will display progress and create the resource in Azure.

---

**Step 6: Validating the Deployment**

1. **Pulumi Outputs:**
    - Check the Pulumi outputs for the connection string of the storage account.
2. **Azure Portal:**
    - Navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
    - Validate that the storage account is present and configured as per the Pulumi definition.

---

**Step 7: Cleaning Up Resources**

To avoid incurring additional charges, you may want to delete the resources:

```bash
pulumi destroy
```

Review and confirm the deletion of the resources.

---

**Conclusion**

Through this hands-on guide, you've successfully created a new Pulumi project and deployed an Azure Storage Account, taking a practical step into managing cloud resources with Pulumi. Pulumiâ€™s ability to leverage familiar programming languages and integrate with various cloud providers makes it a versatile choice for developers and DevOps professionals.
