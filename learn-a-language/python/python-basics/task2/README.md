# Task 2: Write a script to print "Hello, DevOps!".

### Let's jump right in and write our first script!

### **1. Setting Up Your Workspace**

First, open your terminal. macOS comes with a built-in terminal that provides a gateway to command-line tools. For our script, we'll use the built-in **`nano`** text editor. To create a new Python file, type:

```
nano hello_devops.py
```

This opens a blank file named **`hello_devops.py`**.

### **2. Writing the Script**

In this file, we'll write a simple command to print a greeting. Type in the following:

```
print("Hello, DevOps!")
```

### **3. Saving Your Work**

Once you've typed out the command, it's time to save and exit:

- In **`nano`**, press **`CTRL + O`** to write the changes.
- Press **`Enter`** to confirm.
- Then, press **`CTRL + X`** to exit the editor.

### **4. Running the Script**

With our script written, it's execution time! In the terminal, ensure you're in the directory where you saved the **`hello_devops.py`** file. Then, run:

```
python3 hello_devops.py
```

If all goes well, you should be greeted with:

```
Hello, DevOps!
```

### **Taking Your First Step in the Python World**

Congratulations! You've just written and executed your first Python script. While it might seem simple, this foundational knowledge is crucial. As you progress, you'll find that Python's simplicity combined with its power can assist you in various DevOps tasks, from infrastructure automation to log analysis.

Stay curious, keep experimenting, and remember: every expert was once a beginner. Happy coding!
