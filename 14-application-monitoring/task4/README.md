Widgets are the building blocks of your dashboard. They allow you to display various visualizations, such as charts, graphs, and other data representations. To add a widget:

- Click the "Add Widget" button on your dashboard.
- Select the visualization type you want to use (e.g., line chart, bar graph, heat map, etc.).
- Configure the widget by specifying the data source, metric, and additional parameters. Datadog's query language is flexible and allows you to tailor the visualization to your needs.

### **4. Organizing Your Dashboard**

As you add widgets, you can arrange them on your dashboard to create a logical layout. You can:

- Drag and drop widgets to reposition them.
- Resize widgets to adjust their size.
- Create multiple rows or columns to organize widgets neatly.

### **5. Customizing Your Widgets**

Each widget can be customized to suit your specific monitoring requirements:

- You can set a title for the widget to describe the data it displays.
- Apply filters to narrow down the data displayed.
- Configure thresholds and alerts for the widget to notify you when metrics cross certain boundaries.

### **6. Saving Your Dashboard**

Don't forget to save your custom dashboard! Click the "Save Dashboard" button to store your configuration for future access.

### **7. Sharing Your Dashboard**

You can share your custom dashboard with team members or stakeholders by using Datadog's sharing options. You can generate a shareable link or embed the dashboard in other platforms.
