### 2. Navigating the New Relic One Dashboard

The New Relic One dashboard is organized to provide easy access to various monitoring and performance analysis tools. Key sections and features include:

- **Home**: The default landing page where you can view high-level overviews of your applications and infrastructure.
- **Applications**: Access application-specific performance data, including response times, error rates, and user satisfaction.
- **Infrastructure**: Monitor the health and performance of your servers, databases, and cloud infrastructure.
- **Browser**: Analyze user experience by tracking page load times, JavaScript errors, and user interaction data.
- **Mobile**: Monitor the performance of your mobile applications and understand user interactions.
- **Synthetics**: Set up synthetic tests to proactively monitor your applications' availability and performance.
- **Alerts & AI**: Configure and manage alerts based on performance thresholds and utilize artificial intelligence for anomaly detection.

### 3. Exploring Application Dashboards

Within each section (Applications, Infrastructure, Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics), you can explore detailed dashboards specific to that category. For example, in the Applications section, you can:

- View application-specific performance data, such as response times, throughput, and error rates.
- Analyze the performance of individual services or components within your application.
- Access transaction traces to understand the behavior of specific user interactions.
- Correlate performance metrics with application code and transactions to identify bottlenecks.

### 4. Creating Custom Dashboards

New Relic allows you to create custom dashboards tailored to your specific monitoring needs. You can add widgets to these dashboards to visualize key metrics and insights that matter to your team.
