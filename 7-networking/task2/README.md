# Task 2: Connect to the FTP server using a client like FileZilla and transfer files.

Having set up an FTP server in our previous guide, the subsequent step in mastering FTP management involves connecting to the server and transferring files. FileZilla, a popular FTP client, provides a user-friendly interface to interact with FTP servers and manage file transfers effectively. In this article, we will explore how to utilize FileZilla to connect to our FTP server and manage file transfers.

**Prerequisites**

- An FTP server set up and running (Refer to the previous article)
- FileZilla Client installed on your machine
- FTP user credentials

**Step 1: Installing and Configuring FileZilla**

1. **Download and Install FileZilla**: Visit the [official FileZilla website](https://filezilla-project.org/) and download the FileZilla client. Follow the installation instructions suitable for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
2. **Launch FileZilla**: Open the FileZilla client on your machine.
3. **Connect to the FTP Server**:
    - In the “Host” field, enter the IP address of your FTP server.
    - Input the username and password of the FTP user in the respective fields.
    - Set the port to **`21`** (default FTP port) and click “Quickconnect”.

**Step 2: Navigating and Managing Files with FileZilla**

1. **Understand the Interface**: FileZilla’s interface is divided into two main sections:
    - The left side displays the local machine’s file system.
    - The right side shows the file system of the connected FTP server.
2. **Transfer Files**:
    - To upload a file to the server, navigate to the desired local directory, right-click on the file, and select “Upload”.
    - To download a file from the server, navigate to the file on the server’s file system, right-click, and select “Download”.
3. **Create Directories**:
    - Right-click in the directory where you want to create a new folder and select “Create directory”.
    - Provide a name for the directory and confirm.

**Step 3: Managing File Transfers**

1. **Monitor Transfers**: The bottom section of FileZilla displays the status of file transfers, allowing you to monitor ongoing, queued, and failed transfers.
2. **Manage Queued Files**: You can pause, resume, or stop file transfers by right-clicking on them in the “Queued files” tab.
3. **View Transfer History**: The “Successful transfers” and “Failed transfers” tabs provide insights into the history of your file transfers.

**Step 4: Disconnecting from the FTP Server**

- Once file transfers are complete, ensure to disconnect from the FTP server by clicking “Server” in the menu bar and selecting “Disconnect”.

**Conclusion**

Successfully connecting to an FTP server and managing file transfers are fundamental skills in handling file distributions and backups in a DevOps environment. FileZilla simplifies these tasks with its intuitive interface and robust file management capabilities.
