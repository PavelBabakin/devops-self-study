# Task 8: Set up a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline and CodeDeploy.

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) are pivotal in modern development practices, ensuring that code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed. AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeDeploy are powerful services that facilitate CI/CD by automating the build and deployment phases, respectively. In this guide, we will explore how to set up a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline and deploy applications using AWS CodeDeploy.

**Step 1: Setting Up AWS CodePipeline**

- **Navigate to CodePipeline**: From the AWS Management Console, click on “Services” and select “CodePipeline”.
- **Create Pipeline**: Click on the “Create pipeline” button.
- **Pipeline Settings**: Assign a name to your pipeline and choose a service role.
- **Source Stage**: Define the source provider (e.g., AWS CodeCommit, Amazon S3, GitHub) and specify the repository and branch.
- **Build Stage**: Choose a build provider (e.g., AWS CodeBuild, Jenkins) and configure the build project.
- **Deploy Stage**: Select AWS CodeDeploy as the deploy provider and configure the deployment details.
- **Create**: Review your configurations and click “Create pipeline”.

**Step 2: Configuring AWS CodeDeploy**

- **Navigate to CodeDeploy**: From the AWS Management Console, click on “Services” and select “CodeDeploy”.
- **Create Application**: Click on the “Create application” button.
- **Application Name and Platform**: Assign a name and choose the compute platform (e.g., EC2/On-Premises, AWS Lambda, Amazon ECS).
- **Create Deployment Group**: Define the deployment group name, service role, and deployment type.
- **Environment Configuration**: Choose the environment type and configure instances.
- **Deployment Settings**: Select a deployment configuration and choose options for load balancing.
- **Create**: Click on the “Create deployment group” button.

**Step 3: Initiating a Deployment**

- **Create Deployment**: In the CodeDeploy dashboard, select your application and deployment group, then click on “Create deployment”.
- **Deployment Group and Revision**: Choose the deployment group and specify the revision type and location.
- **Deployment Configuration**: Choose a deployment configuration and set up options for load balancing.
- **Deploy**: Click on the “Deploy” button.

**Step 4: Monitoring the CI/CD Pipeline**

- **CodePipeline**: Navigate to CodePipeline and select your pipeline to view the details of each stage and action.
- **CodeDeploy**: In CodeDeploy, select your application and deployment group to view the deployment details and lifecycle events.

**Conclusion**

Setting up a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline and CodeDeploy automates the development workflow, ensuring that code changes are seamlessly built, tested, and deployed. This streamlined approach enhances collaboration, reduces manual errors, and accelerates the release of applications.
