# Task 11: Apply the policy to a token and test the permissions.

As we continue our journey to master HashiCorp Vault, we've unlocked the potential of Vault policies in the previous task. In this article, we'll dive into Task 11: Applying Vault policies to tokens and testing the permissions they grant. This is where we put our access control policies to the test.

## **Policies and Tokens in Vault**

In HashiCorp Vault, policies define what a token can and cannot do within the Vault ecosystem. Tokens, on the other hand, represent an identity that can be associated with policies. By applying a policy to a token, you grant specific permissions to that identity.

## **Applying a Policy to a Token**

To apply a Vault policy to a token and test the permissions it grants, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Open Your Terminal**

Open your terminal and ensure you have a running Vault instance with the policies you want to apply.

**Step 2: Create or Retrieve a Token**

You can create a new token or retrieve an existing one. Use the following command to create a new token and associate it with a policy:

```
vault token create -policy=my-read-policy
```

Replace **`my-read-policy`** with the name of the policy you want to associate with the token.

**Step 3: Test the Permissions**

With the token in hand, you can now test the permissions it grants. For instance, if the policy is designed to grant read-only access to secrets under the **`secret/data/myapp/`** path, you can use the following command to read a secret:

```
vault kv get secret/data/myapp/secret-name
```

If the policy is correctly applied, this command should succeed and return the secret. If the policy restricts write access, attempting to write a secret will result in a permission denied error.

**Step 4: Verify Access**

Verify that the token can perform actions according to the policy's permissions. For instance, if the policy grants access to specific paths, test accessing these paths. If it restricts access to other paths, verify that those actions are denied.

## **Benefits of Testing Permissions**

Testing permissions ensures that your access control policies are correctly applied and effectively restrict or allow access as intended. It provides the following benefits:

1. **Security**: Confirm that sensitive data and resources are adequately protected.
2. **Compliance**: Ensure that your security policies align with regulatory requirements.
3. **Identity Verification**: Verify that tokens and identities are correctly configured.
4. **Access Control Validation**: Test that users, roles, and applications can perform authorized actions.

## **Best Practices**

When applying policies to tokens and testing permissions, consider these best practices:

1. **Testing Environment**: Conduct testing in a controlled environment that mirrors your production setup.
2. **Regression Testing**: Regularly test permissions, especially after policy updates or changes.
3. **Logging and Auditing**: Implement logging and auditing to track token and policy usage for security and compliance.
4. **Review and Review Again**: Review your policies and tokens to ensure that permissions are correctly configured.

## **Conclusion**

Applying Vault policies to tokens and testing permissions is a crucial step in securing access and secrets within HashiCorp Vault. It validates that your access control policies are correctly defined and functional.
