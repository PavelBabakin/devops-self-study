# Task 15: Use git stash to temporarily save changes that are not ready to be committed.

In the realm of Git, managing uncommitted changes efficiently while switching between branches or tasks is crucial. **Git Stash** is a feature that allows you to temporarily save changes without committing them, providing a clean working directory. In this article, we will explore how to use **`git stash`** to manage your workspace effectively, ensuring that you can navigate between tasks without losing progress.

### Understanding Git Stash

**Git Stash** acts like a clipboard for your changes, allowing you to:

- **Save Changes**: Temporarily store uncommitted changes.
- **Retrieve Changes**: Apply stashed changes back to your working directory.
- **Maintain Cleanliness**: Keep a clean working directory when switching contexts.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Using Git Stash

### **Step 1: Stashing Your Changes**

- Save your uncommitted changes using **`git stash`**:

```bash
git stash
```

- Optionally, provide a message to describe the stashed changes:

```bash
git stash save "[Your Message]"
```

Replace **`[Your Message]`** with a descriptive message for the stashed changes.

### **Step 2: Navigating with a Clean Directory**

- With the changes stashed, your working directory is clean, allowing you to switch branches, pull changes, or perform other tasks without interference.

### **Step 3: Viewing Your Stashed Changes**

- List your stashed changes using:

```bash
git stash list
```

- Each stash is identified with a name like **`stash@{0}`**, **`stash@{1}`**, etc., and shows the branch name along with the stash message.

### **Step 4: Applying Stashed Changes**

- Apply a stash and keep it in the stash list using:

```bash
git stash apply [Stash-Name]
```

Replace **`[Stash-Name]`** with the name of the stash you want to apply (e.g., **`stash@{0}`**).

- Or, apply the most recent stash and remove it from the stash list using:

```bash
git stash pop
```

### **Step 5: Deleting Stashed Changes**

- If you want to delete a specific stash, use:

```bash
git stash drop [Stash-Name]
```

Replace **`[Stash-Name]`** with the name of the stash you want to delete.

- To clear all stashed changes, use:

```bash
git stash clear
```

### Best Practices for Using Git Stash

- **Descriptive Messages**: Always provide descriptive messages when stashing changes to easily identify them later.
- **Regular Check**: Periodically check your stash list to ensure it doesnâ€™t become cluttered with obsolete changes.
- **Use Sparingly**: While stashing is useful, try to commit changes to a feature or bugfix branch when possible to maintain a clear history.
