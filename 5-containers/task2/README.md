# Task 2: Run your first Docker container using the docker run command with a basic image like hello-world.

Having successfully installed Docker on your machine, you've paved the way to delve into the world of containerization. The next step in our journey through the DevOps roadmap involves running your first Docker container. In this article, we will guide you through the process of running a basic Docker container using the classic "Hello, World!" image.

### What is a Docker Container?

A Docker container is a standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files. Containers are isolated from each other and abstract the underlying infrastructure, ensuring they are portable and consistent across various environments and stages of the development lifecycle.

### Running Your First Docker Container

### **Step 1: Ensure Docker is Running**

Before running a container, ensure Docker is running on your machine. You can do this by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
docker --version
```

This command should return the installed Docker version, confirming that Docker is running successfully.

### **Step 2: Execute the Docker Run Command**

To run your first Docker container, execute the following command:

```
docker run hello-world
```

Here's what happens when you run the command:

- Docker searches for the **`hello-world`** image locally on your machine.
- If the image is not found locally, Docker downloads it from the Docker Hub, which is a cloud-based registry service that allows you to share Docker images with others.
- Once the image is available, Docker creates a container from that image and runs the application.

### **Step 3: Understand the Output**

Upon executing the command, you should see an output similar to the following:

```
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
[...]
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
[...]
```

This output indicates that:

- Docker attempted to find the **`hello-world`** image locally, was unable to find it, and therefore pulled it from Docker Hub.
- Docker successfully downloaded the **`hello-world`** image.
- A Docker container was created and started, displaying a greeting message confirming that Docker is configured correctly.

### What Happens Behind the Scenes?

When you execute the **`docker run`** command, several operations occur behind the scenes:

- **Pull**: Docker pulls the specified image from a registry (like Docker Hub) unless it is already available locally.
- **Create**: Docker creates a new container from the image.
- **Run**: Docker runs the application within the container.

### Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully run your first Docker container, marking a significant milestone in your DevOps learning journey. This simple "Hello, World!" example lays the foundation for more complex operations and workflows that you'll encounter as you delve deeper into Docker and containerization.
