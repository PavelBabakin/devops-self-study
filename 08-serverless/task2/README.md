**Step 2: Creating and Deploying Your First Worker**

1. **Initiating a New Worker:**
    - Click on the “Create a Worker” button, which will redirect you to the online editor where you’ll script and deploy your worker.
2. **Understanding the Worker Template:**
    - The editor provides a default template with a sample script. The script consists of an **`addEventListener`** that listens for **`fetch`** events and responds with "Hello worker".
    
    ```jsx
    addEventListener('fetch', event => {
      event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
    })
    
    async function handleRequest(request) {
      return new Response('Hello worker', {status: 200})
    }
    ```
    
3. **Modifying the Script:**
    - Feel free to modify the script as per your requirement. For instance, you might want to customize the message that is returned by the worker.
4. **Testing the Worker:**
    - Utilize the embedded testing tool to send requests to your worker and view the responses, ensuring that it behaves as expected.
5. **Deploying the Worker:**
    - Once satisfied with your script and its functionality, click on the “Save and Deploy” button to make your worker live.

**Step 3: Configuring Worker Routes**

1. **Defining a Route:**
    - Go back to the “Workers” tab on your dashboard and select your deployed worker.
    - Under the “Routes” section, define the route pattern that determines which requests should be directed to your worker.
2. **Assigning the Worker:**
    - Assign your deployed worker to the defined route, ensuring that incoming requests matching the pattern are processed by your worker.

**Step 4: Verifying the Deployment**

1. **Sending a Request:**
    - Use a tool like **`curl`** or Postman, or simply navigate to the defined route using a web browser to send a request to the worker.
2. **Validating the Response:**
    - Ensure that the response from the worker matches your expectations, confirming that it has been deployed successfully.
