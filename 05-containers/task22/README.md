# Task 22: Understand LXC's storage backends and configure a new storage pool.

Storage management is a crucial aspect of containerization in LXC (Linux Containers), ensuring that containers have access to the necessary storage resources and that data persistence is handled effectively. In this guide, we will explore LXC's storage backends and guide you through configuring a new storage pool.

---

### Prerequisites

- LXC installed and configured on your machine.
- Basic understanding of storage concepts.

---

### Understanding LXC Storage Backends

LXC supports various storage backends, each with its own characteristics and use-cases:

### **1. Directory Backend**

- **Description**: Uses a directory on the host filesystem to store container data.
- **Use-case**: Suitable for development and testing environments.
- **Configuration**: Minimal configuration and easy to set up.

### **2. ZFS Backend**

- **Description**: Utilizes the ZFS filesystem, providing features like snapshots and cloning.
- **Use-case**: Ideal for environments requiring data integrity and efficient snapshots.
- **Configuration**: Requires ZFS setup and management.

### **3. LVM Backend**

- **Description**: Uses Logical Volume Management (LVM) for handling container storage.
- **Use-case**: Suitable for production environments requiring logical volume management.
- **Configuration**: Requires understanding and managing LVM.

### **4. Btrfs Backend**

- **Description**: Utilizes the Btrfs filesystem, known for its copy-on-write technology.
- **Use-case**: Ideal for scenarios requiring efficient cloning and snapshot capabilities.
- **Configuration**: Requires Btrfs setup and management.

### **5. Ceph RBD Backend**

- **Description**: Uses Ceph Block Devices for scalable and distributed storage.
- **Use-case**: Suitable for cloud environments and distributed storage scenarios.
- **Configuration**: Requires Ceph cluster setup and management.

### Configuring a New Storage Pool

For this guide, we will configure a directory backend storage pool due to its simplicity and minimal setup.

### **Step 1: Define the Storage Pool**

Create a directory on the host filesystem to act as the storage pool.

```
sudo mkdir /var/lib/lxc/storage-pool
```

### **Step 2: Configure LXC to Use the Storage Pool**

Edit the LXC default configuration file.

```
sudo nano /etc/lxc/default.conf
```

Add the following lines to define the storage pool:

```
lxc.storage.backend = dir
lxc.storage.dir = /var/lib/lxc/storage-pool
```

### **Step 3: Create a New Container**

Create a new container and verify that it utilizes the configured storage pool.

```
sudo lxc-create -t download -n my_container -- -d ubuntu -r focal -a amd64
```

### **Step 4: Verify the Storage Backend**

Ensure that the containerâ€™s root filesystem is stored in the configured storage pool.

```
ls /var/lib/lxc/storage-pool
```

### Conclusion

Understanding and configuring LXC storage backends is pivotal for managing container data effectively. By choosing the appropriate storage backend and configuring storage pools, you ensure that your containers have access to the necessary storage resources, and data management is optimized for your use-case.
