# Task 21: Write a Go utility to automate the deployment of a web application to a cloud provider of your choice.

### **Automating Web Application Deployment to AWS EC2 using Go**

In the world of DevOps, automation is the key. It not only reduces manual effort but also ensures consistency and reliability in deployment processes. In this article, we'll explore how to automate the deployment of a web application to an AWS EC2 instance using Go.

### **Why Go?**

Go, also known as Golang, is a statically typed, compiled language known for its simplicity, efficiency, and strong support for concurrent programming. Its standard library offers a range of packages that make it a powerful tool for various tasks, including automating cloud operations.

### **Prerequisites**:

1. Go installed on your machine.
2. An AWS account.
3. AWS CLI installed and configured with the necessary permissions.
4. AWS SDK for Go.
5. A basic web application ready for deployment.

### **Step-by-Step Guide**:

1. **Setting up AWS SDK in Go**:
    
    Before we start, ensure you've installed the AWS SDK for Go:
    
    ```bash
    go get github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go
    ```
    
2. **Writing the Deployment Utility**:
    
    The core of our automation lies in a Go script that interacts with AWS services. Here's a basic utility that deploys a web application to an EC2 instance:
    
    ```go
    package main
    
    import (
    	"fmt"
    
    	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws"
    	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws/session"
    	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/ec2"
    )
    
    func main() {
    	// Initialize a session using Amazon SDK
    	sess, err := session.NewSession(&aws.Config{
    		Region: aws.String("us-west-2")},
    	)
    
    	// Create EC2 service client
    	svc := ec2.New(sess)
    
    	// Specify the details of the instance that you want to create.
    	runResult, err := svc.RunInstances(&ec2.RunInstancesInput{
    		ImageId:      aws.String("ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"),
    		InstanceType: aws.String("t2.micro"),
    		MinCount:     aws.Int64(1),
    		MaxCount:     aws.Int64(1),
    	})
    
    	if err != nil {
    		fmt.Println("Could not create instance", err)
    		return
    	}
    
    	fmt.Println("Created instance", *runResult.Instances[0].InstanceId)
    
    	// Add tags to the created instance
    	_, err = svc.CreateTags(&ec2.CreateTagsInput{
    		Resources: []*string{runResult.Instances[0].InstanceId},
    		Tags: []*ec2.Tag{
    			{
    				Key:   aws.String("Name"),
    				Value: aws.String("MyGoAppInstance"),
    			},
    		},
    	})
    	if err != nil {
    		fmt.Println("Could not tag instance", err)
    		return
    	}
    
    	fmt.Println("Successfully tagged instance")
    }
    ```
    
    This script initializes a session with AWS, creates an EC2 instance, and tags it for identification.
    
3. **Executing the Utility**:
    
    Navigate to the directory containing your script and run:
    
    ```bash
    go run deploy_to_aws.go
    ```
    
    If everything is set up correctly, you should see messages indicating the creation and tagging of a new EC2 instance.
    

### **Points to Consider**:

- Ensure your AWS credentials are set up correctly. You can use the AWS CLI or environment variables for this.
- The script uses a basic Amazon Linux 2 AMI. Depending on your application, you might need a different AMI or additional configuration.
- This is a basic example. In a real-world scenario, you'd likely have more configurations, error checks, and possibly integration with other services.

### **Conclusion**:

Automating deployments ensures consistency, reduces errors, and speeds up the delivery process. Go, with its powerful standard library and the AWS SDK, provides an efficient way to achieve this automation. As you delve deeper into Go and AWS, you'll discover even more possibilities for automation, making your DevOps processes smoother and more reliable.
